The src directory of this area should contain the macros to analyze
the rootNtuples produced by the /UserCode/Leptoquarks/RootTupleMaker.

These macros need the package /UserCode/Leptoquarks/rootNtupleAnalyzer,
see the README file in
http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/Leptoquarks/rootNtupleAnalyzer/
and in particular Note2 at the end of the file.
