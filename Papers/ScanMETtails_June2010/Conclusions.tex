\section{Conclusions}
We have performed a visual scan of high $\etmiss$ events 
(tc$\etmiss>60$~GeV OR pf$\etmiss>60$~GeV)
in an inclusive sample of 7 TeV pp collision data, 
after applying the official noise clean-up available in CMSSW\_3\_7\_0\_patch2.

It should be pointed out that the results of a visual scan 
are always subject to a personal judgment and cannot guarantee 
the consistency and reproducibility of a rigorous statistical analysis. 
Nevertheless, they should provide with good approximation a realistic 
picture of the events populating the $\etmiss$ tails after applying 
the current noise clean-up.
