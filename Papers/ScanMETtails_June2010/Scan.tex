\section{Scan of high $\etmiss$ events}

The high $\etmiss$ events have been divided in three mutually exclusive categories and stored in the directory \\ 
SKIMDIR = /castor/cern.ch/user/s/santanas/MET/Skims/METtails\_45GeVcut\_May27\_2010/ :
\begin{itemize}
\item Category 1 \quad - \quad Calo$\etmiss>45$~GeV \quad AND \quad tc$\etmiss>45$~GeV\\ 
Root file in RECO format at: \\ SKIMDIR/picked\_events\_CaloMET\_and\_tcMET\_gt\_45GeV\_Artur.root
\item Category 2 \quad - \quad Calo$\etmiss>45$~GeV \quad AND \quad tc$\etmiss<45$~GeV \\
Root file in RECO format at: \\ SKIMDIR/picked\_events\_CaloMET\_gt\_45GeV\_Artur.root
\item Category 3 \quad - \quad Calo$\etmiss<45$~GeV \quad AND \quad tc$\etmiss>45$~GeV \\
Root file in RECO format at: \\ SKIMDIR/picked\_events\_tcMET\_gt\_45GeV\_Artur.root
\end{itemize}

A visual scan of these events have been performed using the CMS event display
software ``Fireworks''. It should pointed out that the results of a visual scan 
are subject to personal judgment. Nevertheless, they should provide
with good approximation a realistic picture of which are the events that populates the tails
of the $\etmiss$ after applying the current noise clean-up.

The result of the scan are summarized in the following sub-sections.

\subsection{Category 1: Calo$\etmiss>45$~GeV AND tc$\etmiss>45$~GeV}

\subsection{Category 2: Calo$\etmiss>45$~GeV AND tc$\etmiss<45$~GeV}

\subsection{Category 3: Calo$\etmiss<45$~GeV AND tc$\etmiss>45$~GeV}
