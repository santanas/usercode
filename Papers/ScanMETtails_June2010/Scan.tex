\section{Scan of high $\etmiss$ events}

Two high $\etmiss$ skims have been produced and stored in the directory \\ 
SKIMDIR = XXXXX :
\begin{itemize}
\item tc$\etmiss$ skim: tc$\etmiss>60$~GeV \\ 
Root file in RECO format at: \\ SKIMDIR/YYYY
\item pf$\etmiss$ skim: pf$\etmiss>60$~GeV \\
Root file in RECO format at: \\ SKIMDIR/YYYY
\end{itemize}

A visual scan of these events have been performed using the CMS event display
software ``Fireworks''. We decided to compare tc$\etmiss$ and pf$\etmiss$ 
tails, since they both uses tracker information to correct the $\etmiss$ 
measurement, while we excluded raw Calo$\etmiss$ algorithm from the analysis, which only relies 
on calorimeter information (and therefore provides a lower $\etmiss$ resolution).

It should pointed out that the results of a visual scan 
are always subject to a personal judgment. 
Nevertheless, they should provide, with good approximation, a realistic 
picture of the events populating the $\etmiss$ tails after applying 
the current noise clean-up. 

The result of the scan for tc$\etmiss$ skim and pf$\etmiss$ skim are summarized 
in the Tables~\ref{tab:tcMETskim} and ~\ref{tab:pfMETskim}, respectively.
