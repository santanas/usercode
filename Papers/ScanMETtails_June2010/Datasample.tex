{\bf Noise cleaning}

``Calotower cleaning'' (employed by tc$\etmiss$):
\begin{itemize}
\item ECAL barrel spikes (reject RecHits): topology (kWeird flag = swiss cross variable) + timing (kOutOfTime flag)~\cite{ECALAt7TeV};
\item HF PMT hits (reject Rechits): topology (HFLongShort flag = PET+S9/S1) + pulse shape (HFDigiTime flag)~\cite{HFDN};
\item HPD/RBX noise in HBHE (reject events): combination of pulse shape and topological variables~\cite{HCALWGNOTE}.
\end{itemize}

``Particle-Flow PF cleaning'' (employed by pf$\etmiss$): \\
PF cleaning~\cite{PFPAS2010} is applied on the PFRechits which are used to reconstruct all PF objects (including pf$\etmiss$).
Timing and topology are used to reject RecHits affected by ECAL and HF noise. Topology only is used to reject rechits affected 
by HBHE noise. In addition an {\it a posteriori} recovery algorithm is applied, targeted to recover real HF energy deposits 
incorrectly flagged by the cleaning procedure. No events are rejected.

NOTE: The HPD/RBX noise filter is applied for the scan of both tc$\etmiss$ and pf$\etmiss$ tails presented in this note, 
in order to have the same number of events passing the selection.

Figure~\ref{fig:met} shows the cleaned tc$\etmiss$ and pf$\etmiss$ distributions for $\approx 60$~M events 
(precisely 58821832 events) passing the event selection described above.
