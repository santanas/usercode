{\bf Noise cleaning}

Noise cleaning/event filter for calotower-based $\etmiss$ algorithms (Calo$\etmiss$ and tc$\etmiss$):
\begin{itemize}
\item ECAL barrel spikes (reject RecHits): topology (kWeird flag = swiss cross variable) + timing (kOutOfTime flag) [XXX];
\item HF PMT hits (reject Rechits): topology (HFLongShort flag = PET+S9/S1) + pulse shape (HFDigiTime flag) [XXX];
\item HPD/RBX noise in HBHE (reject events): combination of pulse shape and topological variables [XXX].
\end{itemize}

Noise cleaning (reject RecHits) for pf$\etmiss$ is described at [XXX]. Timing and topology are used to reject RecHits 
affected by ECAL and HF noise. Topology only is used to reject rechits affected by HBHE noise. No events are rejected.

NOTE: The HPD/RBX noise filter is applied for both the tc$\etmiss$ and pf$\etmiss$ analysis presented in this note, 
in order to have the same number of events passing the selection.

%Figure~\ref{fig:calomet} shows the cleaned Calo$\etmiss$ distribution for $\approx 19.6$~M events 
%passing the event selection described above.
