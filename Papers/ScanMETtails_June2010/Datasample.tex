\section{Datasample, Event Selection, and Noise Cleaning} \label{sec:EventSelection}

Information on the dataset and CMSSW release used to reconstruct the data:
\begin{itemize}
\item dataset: /MinimumBias/Commissioning10-May6thReReco-v1/RECO
\item CMSSW release: CMSSW\_358p3
\end{itemize}

Event selection:
\begin{itemize}
\item BPTX  
\item GOOD VERTEX
\item BEAM SCRAPING FILTER
\item etc..
\end{itemize}

Noise cleaning (see details at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/METNoiseCleanup):
\begin{itemize}
\item ECAL barrel spikes: topology (swiss cross variable) + timing (kOutOfTime flag) [XXX]
\item HF PMT hits: topology (``v2'': PET+S9S1) + timing (rechit-time window cut) = ``v4'' cleaning [XXX]
\item HPD/RBX noise in HBHE: topology (cut on hit multiplicity in an HPD) [XXX]
\end{itemize}

Figure shows the cleaned Calo$\etmiss$ and tc$\etmiss$ distributions for the 19.6 M 
events passing the selection described above.
