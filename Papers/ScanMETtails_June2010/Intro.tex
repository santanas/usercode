\section{Introduction}

Commissioning studies performed with test beams, cosmic runs and 
early 0.9~TeV, 2.36~TeV and 7~TeV pp 
collision data have identified several sources of anomalous noise 
(i.e. noise not produced solely from expected fluctuations in the electronics)
in the calorimeters of the CMS experiment:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it ECAL barrel spikes} - More details are available at~\cite{ECALAt7TeV}.
%Energy deposits in individual channels 
%affected by the noise are cleaned using both topological and 
%timing information of the reconstructed hits. This type of noise is correlated with collisions. 

\item {\it HF PMT hits} - More details are available at~\cite{Chatrchyan:1225105,HFDN}
%Energy deposits in individual channels 
%affected by the noise are cleaned using both topological and 
%timing information of the reconstructed hits. PMT hit noise is correlated with collisions. 

\item {\it IonFeedback/HPD/RBX noise in HCAL barrel and endcaps} - More details are available at~\cite{Chatrchyan:1225105,HCALWGNOTE}.
%Events with identified 
%HPD/RBX noise are removed from the analysis using a filter based on both topological 
%and timing information of the reconstructed energy deposits. IonFeedback noise has also been observed 
%but typically affect a few channels and produces low energy signals. A cleaning for IonFeedback noise 
%is not yet available. HPD/RBX noise is not correlated with collisions. 
\end{itemize}
In addition, machine-induced background, as beam halo events~\cite{BEAMHALONOTE} 
and beam-gas interactions producing large pixel cluster multiplicity~\cite{TRKPAS2010}, have been observed. 

The overlap of either anomalous noise or machine-induced background 
with a pp collision event produces an unbalance in 
the reconstructed missing transverse energy in the event, which can produce 
large tails in the $\etmiss$ distribution. 

We present the results of a visual scan of high $\etmiss$ events 
(tc$\etmiss>60$~GeV OR pf$\etmiss>60$~GeV) in a large inclusive sample of 7 TeV pp collision data, 
after applying the official noise clean-up available in CMSSW\_3\_7\_0\_patch2.
The scan is performed separately for events with tc$\etmiss>60$~GeV and pf$\etmiss>60$~GeV
since two different noise cleaning algorithms are employed (see more details in Section~\ref{sec:EventSelection}).

The CMS software {\it Fireworks}~\cite{FireworksLink} and {\it PFRootEvent}~\cite{PFRootEventLink} 
have been used to produce the event displays and study the events (for illustration purpose, 
only {\it Fireworks} event displays are shown in Section~\ref{EventDisplay}). 
The high $\etmiss$ events have been visually inspected and classified in different 
categories. The results of this scan can provide hints to further improve the noise 
cleaning and to identify possible problems and inconsistencies in the algorithms employed 
in CMS for the $\etmiss$ reconstruction.
