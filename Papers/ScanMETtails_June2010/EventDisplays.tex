\section{Description and event displays of high $\etmiss$ events}

\subsection{EB, spike at EB-EE boundary}
We see EB spikes occurring at the boundary between ECAL barrel and endcaps.

The ECAL spikes topological cuts employed in the calotower-based cleaning for Calo$\etmiss$ and tc$\etmiss$ 
are not currently applied to identify ``spikes'' candidates occurring at the boundary between ECAL barrel and endcaps. 
Spikes at the EB-EE boundary could anyway be removed by the timing cuts. Nevertheless, some of them still survives 
after the noise clean-up, as the event shown in Figure~\ref{fig:EBspikeAtBorder}.
It has been verified that all 22 spikes at EB-EE border reported in the tc$\etmiss$ scan are 
infact reconstructed in-time, and therefore not removed.

All the observed EB spikes at EB-EE border are instead cleaned by PF cleaning, which applies topological cuts 
also at the EB-EE boundary.

\subsection{EB, EE spikes}
We see one event with an isolated spike in ECAL barrel (EB) far from the EB-EE boundaries 
(Figure~\ref{fig:EBEEspike}, left plot) and two events with an isolated spike in ECAL 
endcap (EE) (Figure~\ref{fig:EBEEspike}, right plot).

Calotower-based cleaning for spikes is not applied in EE (it is understood that 
spikes are due to particles hitting an APD, which are mounted only in the ECAL barrel). 
The case of EB spike, far from the EB-EE boundary and not cleaned, should be investigated.

Both events are cleaned by PF; note that PF cleaning for spikes is applied by default also in EE.

\subsection{HF, multi-PMT-hits or phi-strip events}
These events are characterized by several anomalous hits in adjacent cells; sometimes they show up as
a strip of hits at the same $i\phi$ location, as the ones reported in Figure~\ref{fig:HFmultiHits}. 
This type of noise cannot be cleaned by the existing topological algorithms but could 
be cleaned by the timing or pulse shape based 
cleaning if hits are out-of-time or have a malformed pulse shape. 
A topological cleaning based on the multiplicity of hits above certain energy threshold 
at the same $i\phi$ location might be effective at identifying such noise.
The source of such events is not yet fully understood.

Some of these events are identified by PF cleaning but not by calotower based cleaning.
Studies are ongoing to understand the differences.

\subsection{HF, double-PMT-hits}
These events are characterized by significant energy in both long and short fibers in a single
isolated tower, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HFdoublehits}. For high $\etmiss$ events, 
this noise often shows up in the towers located at the smallest $\eta$ 
value in HF ($\eta$=3). This can be explained by the fact that, for a given energy, 
a noise occurring at smaller $\eta$ produces a larger transverse energy, and therefore is more visible at high $\etmiss$.
Anyway it's not excluded that double-hits occurs also at larger $\eta$; but in this case such events might 
fall in the bulk of $\etmiss$ distribution.

This type of noise cannot be cleaned by current calotower-based topological algorithms (PET or S9/S1) but can
be cleaned by the timing or pulse shape based cleaning if hits are out-of-time or have a malformed pulse shape.
However, cases of in-time double-hits with good pulse shape have been observed. In such cases, a cleaning based on
S$8$/S$1$ isolation variable could be effective, where S$8$/S$1$ is defined in a similar way to S$9$/S$1$
with the companion RecHit energy from the same HF tower left out from the sum. 
On the other hand, this type of cleaning is not expected to be fully safe for isolated particles, 
in particular for physically bigger towers at lower $\eta$ values. 
Preliminary studies on the use of S$8$/S$1$ isolation variable have been performed but not yet finalized. 

PF cleaning flags most of these noisy events. Studies are ongoing to understand the differences.

\subsection{HF, PMT hit embedded in a jet} ~\label{sec:HFHitEmbeddedInJet}
These events are characterized by one or more anomalous hits embedded inside a jet, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:HFhitEmbeddedInJet}. This type of noise could arise from muons coming from 
in-flight decays of hadronic particles or from a jet punch-through. In both cases
such jets could be identified using the JetID variables since it is expected that a large fraction of the
total jet energy would come from only one or two HF towers. Due to an overlap between real and anomalous signal there are
two cleaning strategies possible: an entire event could be rejected or a more sophisticated anomalous energy
subtraction algorithm would have to be developed.

Neither calotower-based cleaning nor PF cleaning are able to identify these noise events.

\subsection{HBHE, IonFeedback/HPD/RBX noise}
These events are characterized by low multiplicity noise or single noisy channels in HCAL barrel or endcap.
Two examples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HBHEnoise}.
Improved timing cuts could be employed to identify these residual noise events.

Neither calotower-based cleaning nor PF cleaning are able to identify these residual HBHE noise events.

\subsection{Physics}
It is observed that approximately 30\% of the high $\etmiss$ events consists in physics events, 
typically multi-jet events where the large fake $\etmiss$ is produced by jet energy mis-measurements.
In Figure~\ref{fig:Physics}, you see some examples of physics events with large $\etmiss$. 

In about 50\% of high tc$\etmiss$ events with multi-jet topology, pf$\etmiss$ values are 
smaller than tc$\etmiss$ values. More details can be found in 
the Tables~\ref{tab:tcMETskim} and ~\ref{tab:pfMETskim}, and in the list of events posted at the end of the note.

\subsection{Others, large muon-induced pf$\etmiss$}
We observed 5 events with large pf$\etmiss$ (sometimes a few hundreds GeV) 
but very small Calo$\etmiss$ and tc$\etmiss$. 
The muon is reconstructed as ``global muon'' and ``standalone muon'', 
but not as ``tracker muon''. An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:largeMuonInducedPfMET}.

Info from PF group:

4 events with pf$\etmiss>80$~GeV, with pf$\etmiss$ = 83, 242, 337
and 528 GeV, respectively, and a muon with $|\eta| > 2.2$. 
These muons have all a central tracker track associated to them. They are
indeed not ``tracker muon'', meaning that they fail the tracker-muon
criteria, but they are all global muons (with a track and a stand-alone
muon part) for which the reco::muon pt is not correct. 
What is interesting is that such poorly reconstructed muons are not seen
in the simulation, which points to something odd in the muon and or
tracker alignment or geometry in this large eta region.

calotower-based cleaning; the event on the right is not cleaned by any of the two. 
NOTE: The event display for the left plot is mis-leading since the hit is not single, 
as it seems, but double. In fact, in HF, blue=2*$E_{S}$=hadEnergy, while red=$E_{L}-E_{S}$=emEnergy. 
In this event the emEnergy (``red'') is negative, but both energies in long and short fibers, $E_{L}$ and $E_{S}$, are large
(several hundreds of GeV). The event display only shows positive quantities 
(only the hadEnergy = ``blue''), so the ``negative'' red spike is not visible and it gives the illusion of a single hit. 
It is observed that most of such events cleaned by PF have negative emEnergy, i.e. $E_S>E_L$.}
