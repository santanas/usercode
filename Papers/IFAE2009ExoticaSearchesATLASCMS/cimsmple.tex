\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the prospects for the search of exotic physics 
beyond the Standard Model with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
The results presented here are based on Montecarlo simulations of the
ATLAS and CMS detectors, assuming a scenario with 
100~pb$^{-1}$ of collected integrated luminosity and proton-proton collisions 
at $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. A selection of benchmark analyses is discussed, 
including searches of new physics in the di-lepton, di-jet, and lepton-jet channel, 
and the description of techniques to identify the production of 
heavy stable charged particles using muon detectors. 
The impact on ATLAS and CMS discovery potential 
of having collisions at an energy lower than the design of the machine 
is also discussed.

\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions is a successful theory 
describing strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of elementary 
particles. 
%The SM has been verified with high accuracy by several experiments 
%in the last decades, and no deviations from theoretical expectations 
%have been observed. 
In spite of the perfect agreement with all experimental 
observations, the SM has its natural drawbacks and unsolved theoretical 
problems, ranging from the origin of the particle masses to the nature of the 
Dark Matter in the Universe.

There are several alternative theories to the SM which try to solve such 
open issues. In these models, new physics, in terms of new particles and 
new interactions, is expected to be visible at the TeV energy scale, and 
thus might be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
%Among them Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the plausible theories for the physics 
%beyond the SM. 
In addition to the Supersymmetry (SUSY), 
several other theoretical approaches 
(generally classified as ``Exotica'') has been proposed, 
including for example theories with Extra Dimensions, 
Grand Unification Theories (GUT), and String Theory. 

This paper presents a brief overview of the Exotica searches at the LHC. 
At the present time the LHC is still in commissioning phase 
and the first collisions are expected in the Fall of 2009.
The public results presented here are therefore based on detailed 
Montecarlo simulations of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, 
assuming a scenario with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of collected integrated luminosity 
and proton-proton collisions with an energy in the center 
of mass $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. 
A selection of four ATLAS and CMS benchmark analyses with different 
experimental issues is discussed, including 
search of new physics in the di-lepton
%~(Section~\ref{dilepton})
, di-jet
%~(Section~\ref{dijet})
, and lepton-jet
%~(Section~\ref{leptonjet}) 
channel, 
and the description of experimental techniques to identify the production of 
exotic Heavy Stable Charged Particles (HSCP) 
using muon detectors
%~(Section~\ref{HSCP})
.
%The announced scenario is that the first LHC physics run 
%will be taken at a lower energy ($\sqrt{s} = 10$~TeV) 
%than the machine design, and its impact on the ATLAS and CMS 
%discovery potential are discussed in Section~\ref{10TeVvs14TeV}. 
%Conclusions are given in Section~\ref{Conclusion}.

%An efficient and robust online selection of events (trigger) is a 
%crucial aspect for all Exotica analyses at LHC, mainly to guarantee that 
%interesting signal events are not discarded during the data acquisition chain. 
%The trigger strategies for Exotica are not described in this paper, but 
%has been presented in another contribution during this 
%conference~\footnote{See contribution from Massimiliano Chiroboli 
%FIXME - ADD TITLE OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON EXOTICA TRIGGER STRATEGIES}. 
%The analysis here presented use triggers that are almost 100\% efficient 
%to select signal events, unless otherwise noticed.

\section{Di-lepton channel} \label{dilepton}

New heavy states forming a narrow resonance decaying 
into two high energy (several hunders of GeV) 
leptons with opposite signs are predicted in  
many extensions of the SM (FIXME).
%Grand Unified Theories, 
%Technicolor, little Higgs models, and models 
%including extra dimensions (FIXME - REFERENCE FROM ATLAS NOTE). 
The strictest direct limits on the existence of such 
heavy neutral particles are from searches 
at the Tevatron; the highest excluded mass is currently almost 1~TeV/$c^2$ (FIXME).
%(FIXME - ADD 3 REFERENCES FROM ATLAS NOTE); 
%The di-lepton channels has been studied using similar 
%analysis strategies by both at ATLAS (FIXME) and CMS (FIXME)
%experiments, and consistent results have been found. 

Figure~\ref{fig:MeeAndZPrimeDisc} (Left) shows the distribution of 
the invariant mass of the two leading electrons, $M_{ee}$, in presence of 
a signal from $Z' \rightarrow ee$ with mass of 1~TeV/$c^2$ from the CMS analysis
(FIXME). The dominant SM irreducible background is represented by the Drell-Yan 
continuum and it's expected to be well described by the MC.
Data driven techniques to estimate $t\bar{t}$ and QCD multi-jet
reducible backgrounds are used. The signal extraction is based on a fit 
to the $M_{ee}$ distribution, using a parametrization of signal and 
background shapes. Figure~\ref{fig:MeeAndZPrimeDisc} (Right)
shows the ATLAS discovery potential of 
$Z' \rightarrow ee$ for variuos theory 
models~\footnote{The invariant mass resolution 
in the di-muon channel is expected to be up to an 
order of magnitude worse then the di-electron channel, but reducible backgrounds
are expected to be smaller. Thus the di-muon channel could be competitive, 
especially with early data where the design background rejection may not be 
achieved.}, and suggests that resonance masses 
above the current Tevatron limits could be discovered with 
100~pb$^{-1}$ of data already (FIXME).

\section{Di-jet channel} \label{dijet}
%The LHC is a parton-parton collider in a previously 
%unexplored energy region. If new parton-parton resonances 
%exist then the LHC will produce them copiously. 
%These resonances should also decay to partons giving two jets in the final state. 
%Therefore the experimental motivation to search for di-jet 
%resonances is intuitively obvious. 
%In addition several theoretical models supports the 
%search of new physics in the di-jet channel (FIXME - ADD REFERENCE). 
%Even if the LHC energy is not sufficient 
Several theoretical models predicts the existince of new 
high mass resonances decaying in two jets (FIXME).
Even if the LHC energy is not sufficient to directly produce 
these particles, the new physics might still appear as 
a quark contact interaction (FIXME), and we should 
be able to identify its signals by looking at di-jet events.

%Several experimental approaches have been considered by the 
%ATLAS~\footnote{Results from ATLAS analysis were not yet public at the time 
%of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.} 
%and CMS (FIXME - ADD REFERENCE) analyses to identify new physics 
%in the di-jet channel, including the study of the jet 
%$p_{T}$ spectrum, di-jet mass, and di-jet ratio.
We discuss here the CMS analysis~\footnote{Results 
from ATLAS analysis were not yet public at the time 
of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.}
of the di-jet ratio, used to identify the presence of contact interactions. 
The most sensitive search for contact interactions at the Tevatron 
gives an exclusion on the contact interaction scale 
of $\Lambda^{+} < 2.7$~TeV (FIXME).  

The di-jet ratio is a jet angular variable used to 
discriminate between new physics and QCD multi-jet events, 
that are the dominant SM background in the di-jet channel, defined as  
$N\mbox{(}|\eta|<0.7\mbox{)}~/~N\mbox{(}0.7<|\eta|< 1.3 \mbox{)}$, 
where $N$ is the number of di-jet events with both jets satisfying the 
$|\eta|$ pseudorapidity requirements in parenthesis. 
Figure~\ref{fig:DiJetRatioAndLQMej} (Left) shows the sensitivity of this 
measurements to contact interactions for different values of $\Lambda^{+}$. 
With 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data, contact interaction with
$\Lambda^{+} < 6.8$~TeV can be discovered, which is well above the 
current Tevatron limits.

\caption{Left: Di-jet ratio as a function of di-jet mass in presence of 
contact interactions at different energy scales, 
and for QCD multi-jet background. 
For QCD multi-jet events, the di-jet ratio is almost flat at 0.5. 
In presence of contact interactions, 
leading jets are expected to be more central than QCD multi-jet events, 
thus producing a deviation in the di-jet ratio at high di-jet mass values.
Statistical uncertainties on background estimate are reported.  
Right: Reconstructed electron-jet invariant mass for the signal 
($LQ$ mass of 400~GeV/$c^2$) and the (small) SM background, 
with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data. If $LQ$ are produced at LHC, 
such striking signature will not be missed.}

\end{figure}

\section{Lepton-jet channel} \label{leptonjet}
GUT has inspired many extensions of the SM, and some 
of them predict that new physics would manifest itself in 
final states with high $p_T$ leptons and jets.
For example, the experimentally observed symmetry between 
leptons and quarks has motivated the search for leptoquarks ($LQ$), 
hypothetical bosons carrying both quark and lepton quantum numbers 
that decays in a lepton and a quark.
The lepton-jet invariant mass is a powerful tool to identify the production 
of $LQ$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiJetRatioAndLQMej} (Right). 
The ATLAS analysis shows that the pair production of scalar LQs,  
decaying 100\% of the time in charged electron (or muon) and quark, 
can be discovered up to $LQ$ mass of 500~GeV/$c^2$ with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of 
data~\footnote{Results from CMS analysis were not yet public at the time 
of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.} (FIXME).
The current limit from Tevatron is 256~GeV/$c^2$ (FIXME).

\section{Heavy stable charged particles} \label{HSCP}
Some models of new physics (FIXME) 
predicts the existence of exotic particles that are 
heavy (mass of hundreds of ~GeV/$c^2$), quasi-stable 
({\it i.e.} with lifetime large enough to decay outside of the detector), 
and charged. In the detector, such particles looks like 
minimum ioninizing particles but they are slow ($\beta=E/m<1$). 
Standard muon triggers are inefficient for HSCPs, since 
they arrive late to the muon chambers~\footnote{See details 
at Massimiliano Chiorboli's talk during the conference
%FIXME - ADD TITLE OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON EXOTICA TRIGGER STRATEGIES}. 
}. HSCPs of hadronic nature (such as gluinos or stops) 
can experience also the phenomena of charge flipping, when interacting 
in the calorimeter, thus additionally complicating their online selection.

Once the event is triggered, two offline methods are used by the 
CMS analysis to measure their $\beta$ (FIXME), 
which is the major discriminant element between signal and SM background:
$\beta_{DT}$ is measured from the time delay arrival of the particle
at the muon chambers, while $\beta_{Tk}$ is obtained 
from the $dE/dx$ measured in the sylicon
tracker~\footnote{ATLAS performed studies to measure 
the value of $\beta$ directly at the level 2 of their trigger system 
(FIXME)}. Figure~\ref{fig:HSCPSigBkgPlots} 
shows the correlation between the two measurements for signal (Left) 
and background (Right) events. The analysis results show that 
gluino, stop, and GMSB $\tilde{\tau}$  with mass of about 
1~TeV/$c^2$, 700~GeV/$c^2$, and 200~GeV/$c^2$, 
respectively, can be discovered with with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data.

\caption{Distribution of $\beta_{Tk}^{-1}$ {\it vs} $\beta_{DT}^{-1}$ for
a signal (stop with mass of 500~GeV/$c^2$) and for SM background (right). 
Despite of the large tails in the background distributions due 
to detector resolution, the signal correlation between the two $\beta$ measurements 
allows to define a region in the plane where signal efficiency is large and 
background is almost negligible.}
