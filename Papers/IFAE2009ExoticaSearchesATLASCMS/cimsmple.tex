    This paper presents an overview of prospects for searches for exotic physics 
    beyond the Standard Model with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
    The results presented here are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the
    ATLAS and CMS detectors, assuming 100~pb$^{-1}$ of collected integrated 
    luminosity and proton-proton collisions 
    at $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. A selection of benchmark analyses is discussed, 
    including searches for new physics in the di-lepton, di-jet, and lepton-jet channel, 
    and a description of techniques to identify the production of 
    heavy long-lived charged particles. 
    The impact on discovery potential of ATLAS and CMS  
    of having collisions at an energy lower than the design of the machine 
    is discussed.

\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions is a successful theory 
describing strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of elementary 
particles~\cite{Weinberg:1979pi}. 
%The SM has been verified with high accuracy by several experiments 
%in the last decades, and no deviations from theoretical expectations 
%have been observed. 
In spite of the near perfect agreement with all experimental 
observations, the SM has its natural drawbacks and unsolved theoretical 
problems, ranging from the origin of particle masses to the nature of the 
Dark Matter in the Universe.

There are several alternative theories to the SM which try to solve such 
open issues. In these models, new physics, in terms of new particles and 
new interactions, is expected to be visible at the TeV energy scale, and 
thus might be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
%Among them Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the plausible theories for the physics 
%beyond the SM. 
In addition to Supersymmetry~\cite{Martin:1997ns}, 
several other theoretical approaches 
(generally classified as ``Exotica'') have been proposed, 
that include, for example, theories predicting extra dimensions or 
unification of the fundamental forces of Nature.

This paper presents a brief overview of Exotica searches at the LHC. 
At the present time the LHC is still in the commissioning phase, 
and first collisions are expected in the Fall of 2009.
The results presented here are therefore based on detailed 
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2009wy} and 
CMS~\cite{Bayatian:2006zz,Ball:2007zza} detectors, assuming 100~pb$^{-1}$ 
of collected integrated luminosity and proton-proton collisions 
with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. 
A selection of four ATLAS and CMS benchmark analyses with different 
experimental issues is discussed, including 
searches for new physics in the di-lepton, di-jet, and lepton-jet
channel, and a description of experimental techniques to identify the production of 
exotic heavy long-lived charged particles.
%The announced scenario is that the first LHC physics run 
%will be taken at a lower energy ($\sqrt{s} = 10$~TeV) 
%than the machine design, and its impact on the ATLAS and CMS 
%discovery potential are discussed in Section~\ref{10TeVvs14TeV}. 
%Conclusions are given in Section~\ref{Conclusion}.

%An efficient and robust online selection of events (trigger) is a 
%crucial aspect for all Exotica analyses at LHC, mainly to guarantee that 
%interesting signal events are not discarded during the data acquisition chain. 
%The trigger strategies for Exotica are not described in this paper, but 
%has been presented in another contribution during this 
%conference~\footnote{See contribution from Massimiliano Chiroboli 
%FIXME - ADD TITLE OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON EXOTICA TRIGGER STRATEGIES}. 
%The analysis here presented use triggers that are almost 100\% efficient 
%to select signal events, unless otherwise noticed.

\section{Di-lepton channel} \label{dilepton}

New heavy states consisting of a narrow resonance that decays 
into two high energy (several hundreds of GeV) 
leptons with opposite charge are predicted in  
many extensions of the 
SM~\cite{Georgi:1974sy,ArkaniHamed:2001nc,Randall:1999ee,Lane:1999uh}.
%Grand Unified Theories, 
%Technicolor, little Higgs models, and models 
%including extra dimensions (FIXME - REFERENCE FROM ATLAS NOTE). 
The strictest direct limits on the existence of such 
heavy neutral particles (for example the $Z'$ boson, the hypothetical 
heavy partner of $Z$ gauge boson of the SM) come from searches 
at the Tevatron, and the highest excluded mass is currently around 
1~TeV/$c^2$~\cite{Aaltonen:2008vx,Aaltonen:2008ah,Abazov:2007ra}.
%(FIXME - ADD 3 REFERENCES FROM ATLAS NOTE); 
%The di-lepton channels has been studied using similar 
%analysis strategies by both at ATLAS (FIXME) and CMS (FIXME)
%experiments, and consistent results have been found. 

Figure~\ref{fig:MeeAndZPrimeDisc} (Left) shows the distribution of 
the invariant mass of the two leading electrons, $M_{ee}$, in presence of 
a signal from $Z' \rightarrow ee$ with mass of 1~TeV/$c^2$
from the CMS analysis~\cite{HEEPNOTE}. The dominant irreducible SM background 
is the process Drell-Yan, and it's expected to be 
reasonably well described by the MC. Data-driven techniques to estimate $t\bar{t}$ and QCD multi-jet
reducible backgrounds are used. The signal extraction is based on a fit 
to the $M_{ee}$ distribution, using a parametrization of signal and 
background shapes. Figure~\ref{fig:MeeAndZPrimeDisc} (Right)
shows the ATLAS discovery potential for 
$Z' \rightarrow ee$~\footnote{The invariant 
mass resolution in the di-muon channel is expected to be 
%approximately a factor of 5 
worse then the di-electron channel, 
but reducible backgrounds are expected to be smaller. 
Thus the di-muon channel could be competitive, 
especially with early data where the design background rejection may not be 
achieved.} for various theory 
models, and suggests that resonances with mass 
above the current Tevatron limit could be discovered with 
100~pb$^{-1}$ of data~\cite{DiLepResonancesATLAS}. 
The CMS analysis shows a similar discovery reach.

\section{Di-jet channel} \label{dijet}
%The LHC is a parton-parton collider in a previously 
%unexplored energy region. If new parton-parton resonances 
%exist then the LHC will produce them copiously. 
%These resonances should also decay to partons giving two jets in the final state. 
%Therefore the experimental motivation to search for di-jet 
%resonances is intuitively obvious. 
%In addition several theoretical models supports the 
%search of new physics in the di-jet channel (FIXME - ADD REFERENCE). 
%Even if the LHC energy is not sufficient 
Several theoretical models predict the existence of new 
high mass resonances decaying to two 
jets~\cite{Baur:1989kv,Bagger:1987fz,Angelopoulos:1986uq}.
Even if the energy of the LHC is not sufficient to directly produce 
these new particles, the new physics might still appear as 
a quark contact interaction~\cite{Eichten:1983hw}, 
and the LHC experiments should 
be able to identify its signatures by looking at di-jet events.

%Several experimental approaches have been considered by the 
%ATLAS~\footnote{Results from ATLAS analysis were not yet public at the time 
%of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.} 
%and CMS (FIXME - ADD REFERENCE) analyses to identify new physics 
%in the di-jet channel, including the study of the jet 
%$p_{T}$ spectrum, di-jet mass, and di-jet ratio.
We discuss here the CMS analysis~\cite{DIJETSNOTE}~\footnote{Results 
from ATLAS analysis were not yet public at the time 
of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.}
of the di-jet ratio, used to identify the presence of contact interactions. 
The most sensitive search for contact interactions at the Tevatron 
gives an exclusion on the contact interaction scale 
of $\Lambda^{+} < 2.4$~TeV~\cite{Abbott:1998wh}.  

The di-jet ratio is an effective angular variable used to 
discriminate between the new physics and QCD multi-jet events, 
that are the dominant SM background in the di-jet channel. The di-jet ratio is 
defined as $N\mbox{(}|\eta|<0.7\mbox{)}~/~N\mbox{(}0.7<|\eta|< 1.3 \mbox{)}$, 
where $N$ is the number of di-jet events with both jets satisfying the 
pseudo-rapidity requirements in parenthesis. 
Figure~\ref{fig:DiJetRatioAndLQMej} (Left) shows the sensitivity of this 
measurements to contact interactions for different values of $\Lambda^{+}$. 
With 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data, contact interaction with
$\Lambda^{+} < 6.8$~TeV can be discovered, which is well above the 
current Tevatron limits.
 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Left: Di-jet ratio as a function of di-jet mass in presence of 
contact interactions at different energy scales $\Lambda^{+}$, 
and for QCD multi-jet background. 
For QCD multi-jet events, the di-jet ratio is almost flat at 0.5. 
In presence of contact interactions, the two 
leading jets are expected to be more central than in QCD multi-jet events, 
thus producing a deviation in the di-jet ratio at high di-jet mass values.
Statistical uncertainties on background estimate are reported.  
Systematics uncertainties, mostly due to jet energy scale, are expected to be small, 
since significantly reduced in the ratio.

($LQ$ mass of 400~GeV/$c^2$) and the (small) SM background, 
with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data. If $LQ$s are produced at LHC, 
such striking signature will not be missed.}
\label{fig:DiJetRatioAndLQMej}
\end{figure}

\section{Lepton-jet channel} \label{leptonjet}
Some extensions of the SM predict that new physics would manifest itself in 
final states with high transverse momentum leptons and jets.
For example, the experimentally observed symmetry between 
leptons and quarks has motivated the search for leptoquarks ($LQ$), 
hypothetical bosons carrying both quark and lepton quantum numbers 
that decay in a lepton and a quark~\cite{Acosta:1999ws}.
The lepton-jet invariant mass is a powerful tool to identify the production 
of $LQ$s, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DiJetRatioAndLQMej} (Right). 
The ATLAS analysis~\footnote{Results from CMS analysis were not yet public at the time 
of the conference, and therefore not included in this paper.} 
shows that the pair production of scalar $LQ$s, with a branching fraction of 100\% 
to a charged electron and a light quark can be discovered up to a $LQ$ 
mass of about 570~GeV/$c^2$ with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data~\cite{LQATLAS}. 
The current limit from Tevatron is 256~GeV/$c^2$~\cite{Abazov:2004mk}.

\section{Heavy long-lived charged particles} \label{HSCP}
Some models of new physics predicts the existence 
of exotic particles that are heavy (mass of hundreds of~GeV/$c^2$), 
long-lived (enough to decay outside of the detector) and charged~\cite{Fairbairn:2006gg}. 
Such particles can be distinguished from SM particles
by exploiting their unique signature: a low velocity ($\beta=p/E<1$) 
associated with a high momentum (few hundreds of~GeV/$c$).
%In the detector, such particles look like 
%minimum ionizing particles, but, unlike the 
%relativistic muons, they are slow ($\beta=p/E<1$). 
Despite that these exotic particles arrive late in the muon system, 
ATLAS and CMS experiments have a good trigger efficiency~\footnote{See details 
in Massimiliano Chiorboli's talk during the conference}.
%Standard muon triggers are inefficient for these exotic particles, 
%since they arrive late to the muon chambers~\footnote{See details 
%in Massimiliano Chiorboli's talk during the conference}. 
Long-lived exotic particles with a hadronic nature 
(so called R-hadrons, such as gluinos or stops) 
can experience the phenomena of ``charge flipping'' when interacting 
in the calorimeter, thus complicating their online selection. 
For the online selection of R-hadrons, 
the calorimeter triggers (such as missing transverse energy, 
transverse energy sums or jet triggers) show good performances, 
and represent a valid alternative to the muon triggers.

Two offline methods are used by the 
CMS analysis to measure $\beta$~\cite{HSCP}:
$\beta_{{\rm DT}}$ is measured from the time delay of the arrival of the particle
at the muon chambers~\footnote{ATLAS performed studies to measure 
the value of $\beta$ directly at the level 2 of the on-line 
trigger system~\cite{Aad:2009wy}}, while $\beta_{{\rm Tk}}$ 
is obtained from the $dE/dx$ measured in the silicon tracker. 
Figure~\ref{fig:HSCPSigBkgPlots} shows the correlation between 
the two $\beta$ measurements for signal (Left) 
and background (Right) events. The analysis results show that 
gluino, stop, and GMSB $\tilde{\tau}$  with mass of about 
1~TeV/$c^2$, 700~GeV/$c^2$, and 200~GeV/$c^2$, 
respectively, can be discovered with 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering
\includegraphics[angle=90,width=0.38\textwidth]{betaHSCPSig.eps}\includegraphics[angle=90,width=0.38\textwidth]{betaHSCPBkg.eps}  
\caption{Distribution of $\beta_{{\rm Tk}}^{-1}$ {\it vs} $\beta_{{\rm DT}}^{-1}$  
for signal (stop with mass of 500~GeV/$c^2$) and for SM background (right), 
for 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data. Large tails are seen in the background distribution due 
to detector resolution and $dE/dx$ statistical fluctuation.
The fact that the background mis-measurements of $\beta$ are not correlated  
allows to define a region of the plane where signal efficiency is 
relatively large and background is almost negligible.}

\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}
Four benchmark analyses have been presented to give an
overview of preparation for Exotica searches in ATLAS and CMS 
experiments at the LHC. The results shown have been obtained with 
MC simulation, assuming 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data and proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV, which is the design energy of the LHC.

A few months before the conference, it was officially announced 
that the first LHC physics run will be taken at a lower energy 
($\sqrt{s} = 10$~TeV) than the machine design. Preliminary 
studies, performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, 
have shown that the impact of the lower energy is not dramatic for the 
discovery potential of the experiments (for a $Z'$ with mass of 1 TeV/$c^2$, 
a factor 2 more integrated luminosity is needed to get the same 
sensitivity of 14 TeV collisions). 
In absence of signal observed, ATLAS and CMS could set, already with the 
first 100~pb$^{-1}$ of data, constraints on the models of new physics, 
significantly more stringent than the current Tevatron reach. 
The updated results, for the 10 TeV scenario, of these analyses (and of 
many other searches not covered in this short overview) 
will be presented by ATLAS and CMS collaborations 
in the next months.
