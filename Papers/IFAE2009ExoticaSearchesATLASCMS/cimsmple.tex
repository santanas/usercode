\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the prospects for the search of exotic physics 
beyond the Standard Model with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
The results presented here are based on Montecarlo simulations of the
ATLAS and CMS detectors, assuming a scenario with 
100 pb$^{-1}$ of collected integrated luminosity and proton-proton collisions 
at $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. A selection of benchmark analyses is discussed, 
including searches of new physics in the di-lepton, di-jet, and lepton-jet channel, 
and the description of techniques to identify the production of 
heavy stable charged particles using muon detectors. 
The impact on ATLAS and CMS discovery potential 
of having collisions at an energy lower than the design of the machine 
is also discussed.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions is a successful theory 
describing strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of elementary 
particles. The SM has been verified with high accuracy by several experiments 
in the last decades, and no deviations from theoretical expectations 
have been observed. In spite of the perfect agreement with all experimental 
observations, the SM has its natural drawbacks and unsolved theoretical 
problems, ranging from the origin of the particle masses to the nature of the 
Dark Matter in the Universe.

There are several alternative theories to the SM which try to solve such 
open issues. In these models, new physics, in terms of new particles and 
new interactions, is expected to be visible at the TeV energy scale, and 
thus might be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
Among them Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the plausible theories for the physics 
beyond the SM. In addition, several other theoretical approaches (generally classified 
as ``Exotica'') has been proposed, including for example theories with Extra Dimensions, 
Grand Unification Theories (GUT), and String Theory. 

This paper presents a brief overview of the Exotica searches at the LHC. 
At the present time the LHC is still in commissioning phase 
and the first collisions are expected in the Fall of 2009.
The results presented here are therefore based on detailed 
Montecarlo simulations of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, 
assuming a scenario with 100 pb$^{-1}$ of collected integrated luminosity 
and proton-proton collisions with an energy in the center of mass $\sqrt{s} = 14$~TeV. 
A selection of four ATLAS and CMS benchmark analyses with different 
experimental issues is discussed, that includes 
search of new physics in the di-lepton~(Section~\ref{dilepton}), 
di-jet~(Section~\ref{dijet}), and lepton-jet~(Section~\ref{leptonjet}) channel, 
and the description of experimental techniques to identify the production of 
heavy stable charged particles using muon detectors~(Section~\ref{HSCP}).
The announced scenario is that the first LHC physics run 
will be taken at a lower energy ($\sqrt{s} = 10$~TeV) 
than the design of the machine, with approximately 
100-300 pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected. 
The impact of the reduced accelerator energy on the ATLAS and CMS 
discovery potential is discussed in Section~\ref{10TeVvs14TeV}. 
Conclusions are given in Section~\ref{Conclusion}.

The online selection of events (trigger) is a 
crucial aspect for all Exotica analyses at LHC, mainly to guarantee that 
interesting signal events are not discarded during the data acquisition chain. 
The trigger strategies for Exotica are not described in this paper, but 
has been presented in another contribution during this 
conference~\footnote{See contribution from Massimiliano Chiroboli 
FIXME - ADD TITLE OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON EXOTICA TRIGGER STRATEGIES}. 
In this paper the triggers used are almost 100\% efficient 
to select signal events, unless otherwise noticed.

\section{Di-lepton channel} \label{dilepton}

New heavy states forming a narrow resonance decaying 
into two high energy (several hunders of GeV) 
leptons with opposite signs are predicted in  
many extensions of the SM: Grand Unified Theories, 
Technicolor, little Higgs models, and models 
including extra dimensions (FIXME - REFERENCE FROM ATLAS NOTE). 
The strictest direct limits on the existence of such 
heavy neutral particles are from searches 
at the Tevatron (FIXME - ADD 3 REFERENCES FROM ATLAS NOTE); 
the highest excluded mass is currently almost 1~TeV.
The di-lepton channels has been studied using similar 
analysis strategies by both at ATLAS (FIXME REF) and CMS (FIXME REF)
experiments, and consistent results have been found. 

Figure~\ref{fig:Mee} shows the distribution of the invariant mass 
of the two leading electrons, $M_{ee}$, in presence of 
a signal from $Z' \rightarrow ee$ with mass of 1 TeV from the CMS analysis. 
The dominant SM background is represented by the Drell-Yan 
continuum and it's expected to be well described by the MC.
Data driven techniques to estimate the $t\bar{t}$ and QCD multi-jet
backgrounds are used. The signal extraction is based on a likelihood 
fit to the $M_{ee}$ distribution, using a parametrization of the signal and 
background shapes. Figure~\ref{fig:ZPrimeIntoEEdiscovery}
shows the ATLAS discovery potential of $Z' \rightarrow ee$
for variuos theory models, and suggests that resonance masses 
above the current Tevatron limits could be discovered with 
100~pb$^{-1}$ of data already.
