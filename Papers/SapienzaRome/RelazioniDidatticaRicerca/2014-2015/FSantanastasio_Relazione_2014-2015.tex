\section*{Details of Research Activity in the Period 2014-2015}
\vspace{-5pt}
\hrule
\vspace{10pt}
My research field is the experimental high energy physics. Since 2006
I am part of the CMS collaboration, one of the 4 experiments running at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the 2014-2015 period I worked 
on calibration of reconstructed objects and physics analyses, searching for 
physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). \\[1em]

{\bf Search for new massive resonances in the dijet final state}\\[0.5em]
I have been working on a search for new resonances with mass at the TeV
scale that decay to a pair of jets (dijet). This search is one of the most 
sensitive probes for new physics at LHC because any hypothetical new
particle that might be produced is originated from the
colliding protons and therefore it must couple to quarks and/or
gluons, thus producing jets. The analysis strategy consists in
reconstructing the invariant mass of the dijet system and search for a
resonant peak in its data spectrum. I have been the leading author of this
search in CMS since 2012 publishing a paper on this topic with the
full dataset collected at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2015sja}. After a 3-year
shutdown, the LHC has restarted in April 2015 with an increased 
center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. This energy jump has largely enhanced the
sensitivity of the dijet search to new physics. Since September 2014, I
am coordinating the group, made of about 20 physicists, devoted to the
analysis of the early 13 TeV data. The analysis performed on the data
collected in 2015 has shown no sign of new particle
production, setting the most stringent limits in this final state for several new physics
models. The results of this search, thanks to their
relevance for this scientific 
field, have been accepted for publication by PRL~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dcf}. 
This is also the first search for new physics at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV from LHC. \\[1em]

{\bf Search for sub-TeV dijet resonances using the novel {\it CMS data scouting} technique}\\[0.5em]
It is important to extend the dijet search in the
mass region below 1 TeV in order to probe hypothetical hadronic resonances with small
couplings to quarks and gluons that similar searches performed at previous
colliders could not find yet. The main experimental difficulties at LHC originate
from the large cross section of multijet events at low dijet mass 
and the finite computing resources for processing and storing these
data. To solve this issue, I first proposed in 2011 a new technique known as 
{\it data scouting}. This technique, by significantly reducing the event size
compared to the standard CMS data stream, enabled CMS to relax the
trigger thresholds and record 1 KHz of fully hadronic events to extend
the search in the sub-TeV mass region. With this approach, the
analysis is performed using jets reconstructed online in the CMS
trigger computing farm. 
This novel research strategy was fully integrated in the CMS physics program in
2012, when I was convener of the {\it``CMS Dataset Definition Team"}, 
allowing to collect data corresponding to almost 19 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV in the sub-TeV dijet mass region. 
I worked at the search for dijet resonances using these data~\cite{CMS:2015neg}.  
No evidence for new particle production is found and the most
stringent limits to date are set on the production cross section of dijet resonances
in the mass range from 500 to 800 GeV. A paper, to be submitted to PRL, is 
in preparation. \\ [1em]

{\bf Search for new massive resonance in diboson final states} \\[0.5em]
Many theories beyond the SM predict the existence of massive particles
at the TeV scale that decays into pairs of SM bosons. The bosons
coming from the massive particle can be W, Z, H or $\gamma$. 
As convener of the {\it CMS Exotica Leptons+Jets Working
Group} in the 2013-2014 period I contributed to various diboson
analyses in final states involving leptons and jets, documented in 
3 papers~\cite{Khachatryan:2015ywa,Khachatryan:2014gha,CMS:2015neg}.
In particular, I was deeply involved in the search for massive resonances in the WW and ZZ 
final states using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV, focusing
on the analysis of the semi-leptonic ($\ell\ell qq$ and $\ell\nu qq$) 
and fully-hadronic ($qqqq$) decay modes~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha}.
These decay channels have the largest branching fraction, providing
a higher sensitivity to new physics for resonance masses above 1 TeV
compared to the fully leptonic channels.
These are quite complex analyses. For resonances with mass above 1 TeV, the momentum of the W and Z
bosons greatly exceeds their rest mass, and the quarks from their decay
are emitted with a small angular separation in the laboratory
reference frame, thus resulting into a single massive jet.  
By exploiting the substructure of a wide jet, it is possible to
discriminate between the dipolar structure of an hadronic boson decay (signal events)
and a jet created by the hadronization of a single quark/gluon (background events).
The WW and ZZ searches were among the first in CMS to include the
jet-substructure reconstruction algorithms in a physics analysis and
my work contributed to define the experimental
methodology for this kind of research in CMS. \\ [1em]
