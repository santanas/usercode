\section*{Details of Research Activity in the Period 2014-2017}
\vspace{-5pt}
\hrule
\vspace{10pt}
My research field is the experimental high energy physics. Since 2005
I am part of the CMS collaboration, one of the 4 experiments running at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). During these years, I have been
involved in several detector activities including calibration of the
CMS electromagnetic calorimeter, commissioning of the CMS hadronic
calorimeter, performance studies of the missing transverse energy
reconstructed in the event, and I participated to several physics analyses.
In the 2014-2016 period I focused on searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM) and on jet calibration studies. 
Since 2014 I'm also part of the i-MCP collaboration. This is
an R\&D project within INFN CSN5 aimed at use of micro-channel plates for
precise timing measurement of single particles and electromagnetic showers
at collider experiments. \\[1em]

{\bf Search for new resonances in the dijet final state}\\[0.5em]
I have been working on a search for new resonances with mass at the TeV
scale that decay to a pair of jets (dijet). This search is one of the most 
sensitive probes for new physics at LHC because any hypothetical new
particle that might be produced is originated from the
colliding protons and therefore it must couple to quarks and/or
gluons, thus producing jets. The analysis strategy consists in
reconstructing the invariant mass of the dijet system and searching for a
resonant peak in its data spectrum. I have been the leading author of this
search in CMS since 2012 publishing a paper on this topic with the
full dataset collected at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2015sja}. After a 2-year
shutdown, the LHC has restarted proton-proton collisions in 2015 with an increased 
center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. This energy jump has largely enhanced the
sensitivity of the dijet search to new physics. In the last two years, 
I coordinated the group
%I am coordinating the group, 
made of about 15 physicists devoted to the
analysis of the early 13 TeV data. The analysis performed on the data
collected in 2015 and 2016 has shown no sign of new particle
production, setting the most stringent limits in this final state 
for several new physics models. 
I was primary author of two high-impact papers using proton-proton
collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2016iap,Khachatryan:2015dcf}.
These include the first published limits in the dijet final state on the
mass of a mediator of the interaction between a hypothetical 
{\it dark matter} particle and the SM quarks. \\[1em]
%The results of this search, thanks to their
%relevance for this scientific 
%field, have been accepted for publication by
%PRL~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dcf} in January 2016. 
%This is also the first search for new physics in proton-proton
%collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV from LHC. 

%{\bf Search for hadronic resonances using the novel {\it data
%    scouting} technique}\\[0.5em]
{\bf The novel {\it data scouting} technique in hadronic resonance searches}\\[0.5em]
At LHC, it is important to extend the search for resonances in fully hadronic
final states in the mass region below 1 TeV in order to probe 
%hypothetical hadronic resonances with 
small couplings to quarks and gluons not yet excluded by previous colliders.
%that similar searches performed at previous
%colliders could not exclude yet. %find yet. 
The main experimental difficulties at LHC originate
from the large cross section of multijet events at low jet transverse
momentum
%dijet mass 
and the finite computing resources for processing and storing these
data. To solve this issue, I proposed in 2011 a new technique - known as 
{\it data scouting} - in the CMS experiment. This technique, by significantly reducing the event size
compared to the standard CMS data stream, enabled to relax the
trigger thresholds and record 1 KHz of fully hadronic events to extend
the search in the sub-TeV mass region. With this approach, the
analysis is performed using jets reconstructed online in the CMS
trigger computing farm. %This new method, initially developed for the dijet
%analysis, can have large impact on several new physics searches in
%fully hadronic final states.
This novel trigger strategy was fully integrated in the CMS physics program in
2012, when I was convener of the {\it``CMS Dataset Definition Team"}, 
allowing to collect data corresponding to almost 19 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV; 
%in the sub-TeV dijet mass region; 
this technique was implemented also by LHCb and ATLAS
experiments at LHC in the following years.
Since 2014, I worked at a search for sub-TeV dijet resonances using these data.
No evidence for new particle production was found and the most
stringent limits to date were set on the production cross section of dijet resonances
in the mass range from 500 to 800 GeV. These results were published in
2016 by PRL~\cite{Khachatryan:2016ecr}. \\[1em]

{\bf Search for new resonances in diboson final states} \\[0.5em]
Many theories beyond the SM predict the existence of massive particles
at the TeV scale that decays into pairs of SM bosons. The bosons
coming from the massive particle can be W, Z, H or $\gamma$. 
As convener of the {\it CMS Exotica Leptons+Jets Working
Group} in 2013 and 2014, I contributed to various diboson
analyses in final states involving leptons and jets, documented in 
3 papers~\cite{Khachatryan:2016yji,Khachatryan:2015ywa,Khachatryan:2014gha}.
In particular, I was deeply involved in the search for massive resonances in the WW and ZZ 
final states using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV, focusing
on the analysis of the semi-leptonic ($\ell\ell qq$ and $\ell\nu qq$)~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha} 
and fully-hadronic ($qqqq$) decay modes~\cite{Khachatryan:2014hpa}.
These decay channels have the largest branching fraction, providing
a higher sensitivity to new physics for resonance masses above 1 TeV
compared to the fully leptonic channels.
These are quite complex analyses. For resonances with mass above 1 TeV, the momentum of the W and Z
bosons greatly exceeds their rest mass, and the quarks from their decay
are emitted with a small angular separation in the laboratory
reference frame, thus resulting into a single massive jet.  
By exploiting the substructure of a wide jet, it is possible to
discriminate between the dipolar structure of an hadronic boson decay (signal events)
and a jet created by the hadronization of a single quark/gluon (background events).
The WW and ZZ searches were among the first in CMS to include the
jet-substructure reconstruction algorithms in a physics analysis and
my work contributed to define the experimental
methodology for this kind of research in CMS. \\[1em]

{\bf Work on jets} \\[0.5em]
High momentum jets, coming from hadronization of energetic quarks and
gluons, are present in almost every collision at the LHC. The detailed
understanding of both the energy scale and resolution of the jets is of crucial importance for
many physics analyses. I worked at the jet energy
calibration using photon+jet events and I studied the energy scale 
and resolution of jets reconstructed at trigger level in the {\it data
scouting} stream. I'm also involved in studies of jet
substructure which are important for diboson analyses. Energetic W or Z
bosons decaying to a pair of collimated quarks can be reconstructed as
single massive jets in the detector. 
%Different algorithms have been developed to reconstruct the jet mass
%and identify the dipolar structure of energy deposits inside the
%jets. 
The effectiveness of algorithms to identify the jet substructure 
is studied using simulated events and it is sensitive to the details
of Monte Carlo parton showering. Since it is crucial to validate 
these methods using real data, I studied these algorithms using 
a pure sample of energetic W bosons coming from top quark 
decays in t$\bar{\rm{t}}$ semi-leptonic events. 
By comparing results in data and simulation, it is
possible to derive correction factors for the jet mass
scale/resolution and for the efficiency of the jet substructure 
requirements. These correction factors, measured with 5-10\%
uncertainty, are used in several searches for new physics in CMS. \\[1em]

{\bf Precise timing measurements at future colliders} \\[0.5em]
Future hadron colliders will provide instantaneous luminosities 
exceeding $10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and the large number of 
simultaneous collisions in each interaction (pileup events) will be a
major challenge. While one collision contains the rare signatures of interest for discoveries 
or SM precision measurements, the contribution of the remaining
pileup interactions must be reduced to maintain good performance of
calorimeters in terms of energy measurements and particle
identification. For example, in the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC
(HL-LHC), more than 140 interactions per beam crossing, with 
a spread of approximately 10 cm and 300 ps
along the beam axis, are anticipated. This represent an increase of
more than a factor 5 with respect to the current LHC pileup
conditions. A possible strategy to reduce the impact of
increasing pileup, consists in complementing the transversal segmentation of
the calorimeters with an extremely high time-resolution, 
which would enable the energy deposits coming from different 
interaction vertices to be resolved in time. Micro Channel Plates
(MCPs) are good candidate detectors for this scope, thanks to their
excellent time response. I'm involved in R\&D studies on the
ionization-MCP (i-MCP) where the avalanche formation is triggered by secondary
emission of electrons directly on the MCP surface, when this is hit by
relativistic charged particles. The advantage consists in the elimination of the
photo-cathode, improving the radiation tolerance of the device.
The demonstration of the i-MCP concept has been achieved on both 
commercial device and bare MCPs tested inside a custom vacuum 
chamber designed in Rome. In some configurations, detection
efficiencies to single particles above 80\% are reached with time
resolution around 20 ps. 
Initial results have been published on NIM~\cite{Brianza:2015jia} and a second 
publication based on test beams performed in the last two years 
is expected in 2017.
