I started my 2-year mandate on September 1st, 2016.
This analysis group works on searches for new physics beyond the
Standard Model in final states containing jets. The group, 
constituted by more than 50 physicists working in universities and
research institutions from all the world, performs
about 10 physics analyses in this final state. The results of these
searches are expected to be published in 2017. \\ [1em]
%%% Dijet
\years{09/2014 - 09/2016}\textbf{Coordination of the \emph{Dijet Resonance
  Team} of the CMS experiment}\\
This analysis team works on searches for new massive resonances at the TeV
scale decaying into a pair of jets using the dijet mass spectrum. It is
constituted by almost 20 physicists from several institutions from
all the world. This group produced two high-impact papers using proton-proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2016iap,Khachatryan:2015dcf}, 
including the first published limits in the dijet final state on the
mass of a mediator of the interaction between dark
matter and standard model particles. \\[1em]
%This group produced the first paper at LHC on a
%search for new physics using proton-proton collisions at

%%% Leptons+Jets

This analysis group works on searches for new physics beyond the
Standard Model in final states containing leptons and jets. The group, 
constituted by more than 50 physicists working in universities and
research institutions from all the world, performed about 15 physics
analyses in this final state. During my convenership, the group
produced 3 publications~\cite{Khachatryan:2014ura,Khachatryan:2014dka,Khachatryan:2014gha}
and 7 preliminary results that were then published or submitted for
publication in 2015
(including~\cite{Khachatryan:2016yji,Khachatryan:2015ywa,Khachatryan:2015vaa}). \\[1em]
%%% DDT
\years{03/2012 - 03/2013}\textbf{Coordination of the \emph{Dataset Definition
  Team} of the CMS experiment}\\ 
Definition of the trigger requirements forming the data streams used for physics analysis and detector
calibration. This responsibility also consists in the design and
implementation of a novel strategy for {\it data parking} and {\it
  data scouting}~\cite{CMS-DP-2012-022}. LHC searches for new particles with sub-TeV masses are hindered by the
high thresholds required to limit trigger rates. The new technique of data scouting, based on online event
reconstruction and small record sizes, allows to lower trigger thresholds and
extend searches for new particles into hitherto unexplored regions.

%%% HCAL PFG 
\years{09/2008 - 09/2010}\textbf{Coordination of the \emph{Prompt

in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV~\cite{CMS:2012yf,AN-12-012}, 8

and 13 TeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2016iap,AN-16-202,Khachatryan:2015dcf,AN-15-063,AN-15-175} with the CMS
detector. The search for new dijet resonances is among the most important ones at LHC because any hypothetical new
particle that might be produced originates from the colliding protons
and therefore it must couple to quarks and/or gluons. This search is
sensitive to the presence of a hypothetical, massive  mediator of the interaction between dark matter and
standard model quarks. These papers received in total more than 500 citations.\\ [1em] 
%% DIJET SCOUTING
\years{09/2011 - today}
Proponent of a novel trigger, data acquisition, and analysis
strategy to recover sensitivity to new dijet resonances at dijet
masses below 1 TeV~\cite{CMS-DP-2012-022} ({\it data scouting}).
Leading author of searches for dijet resonances using the data
scouting technique at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-11-094} 
and $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2016ecr,AN-14-104}. Supervision
of PhD student at Sapienza working on calibration of online
reconstructed jets for the scouting analysis
at~$\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2016iap,AN-16-202}. 
It is important to extend the dijet search in the mass region below 1 TeV 
in order to probe hypothetical hadronic resonances with small
couplings to quarks and gluons that similar searches performed at
previous colliders could not find yet. \\ [1em]

%The analysis contains improvements compared to

the energy scale and resolution of the jets is of crucial importance
for many physics analyses. Jet substructure observables are important 
in several searches for new physics to identify energetic W or Z bosons decaying to 
a pair of collimated quarks and reconstructed as single massive jets
in the detector. \\ [1em]
