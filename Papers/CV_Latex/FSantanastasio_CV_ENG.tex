\section*{Summary of Research Activities}

In December 2007, I started an appointment as post-doctoral research 
assistant ({\it post-doc}) in Particle Physics at the University of Maryland. 
Since then I have been based at CERN, working in the CMS experiment on 
i) data analysis within the exotic physics group (Exotica), 
ii) commissioning, {\it ``prompt analysis''} and detector performance studies 
of the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), and 
iii) commissioning of missing transverse energy (MET) with first collision data at LHC. \\

At CMS, the hadronic calorimeter HCAL is mainly employed, together with electromagnetic calori- meter ECAL, for the reconstruction 
of {\it ``jets''} (the experimental signature of the hadronization of partons) and the missing transverse energy
in the event, hence playing an important role for many physics analyses 
feasible at an hadron collider as LHC. The very forward part of the HCAL is also 
used for luminosity measurement. \\

For the first six months of my appointment with the University of Maryland, I was involved in the 
HCAL commissioning, providing on-call support for data acquisition (DAQ) and trigger configurations 
during the early period of cosmic-ray data-taking by the CMS detector. 
%Thanks to this commissioning work, 
%I could learn details of the HCAL detector that were useful for the activities of data analysis described 
%in the following paragraph. 
In Summer 2009, I contributed to test beam studies of the hadronic calorimeter
(HCAL Test Beam 2009 \cite{Chatrchyan:2010zz}) by commissioning and calibrating the 
{\it ``delay wire chambers''} installed along the H2 beam line (CERN, Prevessin site) 
for beam position measurements. \\

For two years, starting from September 2008, I coordinated the 
HCAL {\it ``Prompt Feedback Group''} (PFG) of the CMS collaboration, 
composed of about 5-10 people. The PFG worked 
on data analysis related to anomalies found in the detector, including 
problems in the firmware of electronics boards, data-format and trigger issues, 
as well as the support to groups devoted to the online ({\it ``Data Quality Monitoring''}, DQM)
and offline ({\it ``Run Certification''}) control of data quality.

On various occasions, I presented to the CMS collaboration the status of the detector on behalf of the HCAL group, 
including talks in plenary meetings that followed the two main cosmic-ray data-taking periods in 2008 and 2009
[see ``Talks in Plenary Meetings of the CMS Collaboration'' $\rightarrow$ talks on behalf on the HCAL group].

At the beginning of 2010, I coordinated the HCAL PFG in preparation to the first LHC {\it pp} collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV, 
which occurred on 30 March 2010. For this event we provided 
results in real time giving evidence of the collisions. The following day, I presented to a CMS plenary meeting the results 
of the very first detector performance analyses based on the {\it pp} collisions on behalf of the HCAL and Jet/MET groups
[see ``Talks in Plenary Meetings of the CMS Collaboration'' $\rightarrow$ talks on behalf on the HCAL and Jet/MET group]. 

In conclusion, the PFG provided a relevant contribution to both the HCAL commissioning in 2008-2009, 
and to the regular operation of the detector during the physics data-taking in 2010. \\

In addition to the research activities related to electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, I joined in November 2009 
the Jet/MET group of CMS, that is employed in development and performance studies of jets and MET reconstruction. 
In the first months of 2010, I played a relevant role in the MET commissioning, using the first {\it pp} collision data 
at $\sqrt{s}=$0.9, 2.36 \cite{JME-10-002} and 7 TeV \cite{JME-10-004}. In particular, I am the main author of the following works:
study of performance of the {\it ``uncorrected calorimeter''} MET \cite{AN-2010-029}, 
classification of events in the non-gaussian tails of the MET distribution \cite{AN-2010-219}, 
and development and implementation of algorithms for the identification of anomalous, beam-induced noise in the 
Hadronic Forward Calorimeter (HF) \cite{DN-2010-008}. The anomalous signals
observed in HF can produce large apparent MET in the event; therefore it's crucial to identify and reject them during the event reconstruction, 
since such uncharacteristic signals can worsen the precision of some physics measurements, or even simulate a fake signature 
of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The understanding of the performance of jets and MET reconstruction is 
an important point for the physics analyses I'm currently working on. \\

Since the beginning of my post-doctoral appointment, I have been involved in the research activities of the 
CMS Exotica group, which is devoted to search for exotic physics beyond the Standard Model. I presented 
the results of these analyses in international conferences on behalf of the CMS collaboration [see ``Talks at Conferences'']. \\

I started my activities in the Exotica group in 2008 with the search for pair production of  first generation scalar {\it ``leptoquarks''} (LQ) 
in the $LQ\overline{LQ} \rightarrow ee qq$ decay channel ({\it eejj}). Leptoquarks are conjectured particles
foreseen by some well-motivated theories beyond of the Standard Model, in which transitions between 
leptonic and baryonic sectors are allowed. The process under study has a very characteristic signature, 
with two high transverse momentum ($p_T$) electrons and two high $p_T$ jets, and a peak in 
the electron-jet invariant mass spectrum corresponding to the LQ mass.

The feasibility study, done in 2009 with full simulation of the CMS detector \cite{EXO-08-010,AN-2008-070},
aimed to the optimization of selection criteria to reject the Standard Model backgrounds, and study
techniques to estimate them directly from data. This work showed that the existence of LQ with mass
about twice higher than the current limit set by Tevatron experiments, could be excluded at CMS with about 
100 pb$^{-1}$ of data in {\it pp} collisions at $\sqrt{s}=10$~TeV. 

The analysis has been performed with 33 pb$^{-1}$ of {\it pp} collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV collected by the CMS experiment in 2010 
\cite{Khachatryan:2010mp,EXO-10-005,AN-2010-230}. The data is in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions. Therefore 
a 95\% {\it ``confidence level''} lower limit is set on the mass of first generation scalar LQ at 384 GeV/$c^2$, assuming a 
branching ratio of 100\% for the decay $LQ\rightarrow eq$. This result exceed the existing Tevatron limit on the LQ mass 
of 300 GeV/$c^2$, obtained with 1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-antiproton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$1.96~TeV, hence extending the search for 
leptoquarks in an unexplored mass region. The paper has been submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett. \\

In addition to the {\it eejj} analysis, I am the contact person of the search for pair production of first generation scalar leptoquarks
in the $LQ\overline{LQ} \rightarrow e\nu qq$ decay channel ({\it e$\nu$jj}) \cite{AN-2010-361}.
The combination of the results from these two channels can be used to improve the sensitivity to the new physics in 
the space of the unknown parameters of the theory model: $M_{LQ}$ vs $\beta$, where $M_{LQ}$ is the LQ mass, and 
$\beta$ ($1-\beta$) is the branching ratio of the decay $LQ\rightarrow eq$ ($LQ\rightarrow \nu q$). 
The {\it e$\nu$jj} analysis aims to publish the results with $\sqrt{s}=$7~TeV {\it pp} collision data in the first months of 2011.\\

\begin{center} \textsc{Research activities during my undergraduate and graduate studies} \\ \end{center} 

My interest in elementary particle physics drove me to choose this field when I was an undergraduate student in Rome 
and, more recently, to do research as part of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) 
of CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire). \\

In 2003, I started working on my undergraduate thesis at \textit{Sapienza}, Universit\`a di Roma. The work concerned the 
study of the calibration of an electromagnetic calorimeter using the energy flow method \cite{Santanastasio:LAUREA}, which allows to inter-calibrate 
calorimeter crystals by using the $\phi$ symmetry of energy deposits at a collider. \\

In October 2004, I was admitted to the graduate school in physics to work with the CMS group. 
The Rome group was heavily involved in the construction of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), 
as well as in monitoring and calibration. In my three years as a graduate student I worked on the calibration of 
the calorimeter, the stability of the ECAL high voltage (HV) system and feasibility studies for physics analysis on the search for Supersymmetry. \\

%The first year of my PhD was mostly devoted to the courses of the graduate school 
%and to learn the CMS software and analysis tools. \\

In 2006, I worked on the feasibility study of using $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decays for the calibration 
of the ECAL crystals \cite{DN-2007-013,IN-2006-050}. This method has the advantage of high 
statistics, since $\pi^0$ are produced in abundance at hadron colliders, and does not rely on information from 
the detectors measuring tracks from charged particles, and hence could be performed {\it ``in situ''} in the early 
periods of data-taking of LHC if the alignment and calibration of the high precision tracking system are not yet understood.
The real challenge of this analysis is finding a satisfactory signal to noise ratio while maintaining high selection efficiency for such events 
in order to achieve a calibration of the entire ECAL in a short period of data-taking.
In 2010 the CMS experiment collected enough data to calibrate the central part (barrel) of ECAL using $\pi^0$'s.
The plans for 2011 foresee the extension of the method to the forward region of the detector (endcaps), 
as well as the combination of different calibration techniques that are available, in order to achieve the design precision 
on the ECAL calibration. \\

During summer of 2006, I participated in the combined test beam of the electromagnetic and 
hadronic calorimeters of the CMS experiment at the H2 area of CERN, Prevessin site 
(H2 Test Beam 2006 \cite{Abdullin:2009zz}), mainly performing data-taking shifts.
An important feature of the H2 test facility was the possibility to produce a secondary beam
of $\pi^0$'s by inserting a target along the primary charged pion beam line. 
This data \cite{Adzic:2008zza} was used to verify and improve the $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ 
reconstruction algorithm developed for the calibration studies with simulated events.
During this period, I also worked on the monitoring of the ECAL high voltage system, which is 
under the direct responsibility of the Rome group. \\
%Thanks to this activity, I was able to learn directly 
%some knowledge of the hardware part related with the operation of electromagnetic calorimeter. \\

My other activities included both development and implementation of the analysis software for the 
stability test of HV boards, and the relative analysis of data collected since 2003 \cite{Bartoloni:2007hx}. 
The stability of the HV system is very important for the operation of ECAL because it affects directly 
the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter. \\

In 2007, I worked mainly on feasibility study of the search for Supersymmetry 
with Gauge-Mediated Breaking (GMSB) in the prompt photon decay channel 
$pp \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0 + X \rightarrow \tilde{G} \tilde{G} \gamma \gamma + X$ 
(see PhD thesis \cite{Santanastasio:DOTTORATO}). 
The presence of two high energy photons and large missing transverse energy
in the final state due to gravitinos makes the experimental signature of such events very clear.
This feasibility study, aimed at the optimization of selection criteria to reject Standard Model backgrounds, 
showed that GMSB models, with parameters just above the limit fixed by Tevatron experiments, 
could be an early discovery at the CMS experiment with O(10) pb$^{-1}$ of data and $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV. 
This result was significantly better than the one shown by previous studies reported in the CMS collaboration.
Even at the current energy of LHC, $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV, the search for new physics in GMSB models 
could extend beyond the limit set by previous experiments with about 100 pb$^{-1}$ of data.
