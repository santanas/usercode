\section{$\etmiss$ stability over 2009 data-taking period}
\label{sc:METStab}

An important aspect of the MET commissioning is monitoring of the
MET-related quantities and their stability over an extended period of
time. Any instability in such quantities during stable beam conditions
can be an indication of some sort of a problem.
Figures~\ref{fig:SumET_vs_run}, \ref{fig:MET_vs_run},
\ref{fig:MEx_vs_run}, and \ref{fig:MEy_vs_run} show the stability of
several MET-related quantities in 2009 collision data with the
HLT\_PhysicsDeclared bit set, including the ``bad'' runs listed in
Sec.\ref{sc:DataSamples}. These type of plots can be used in online DQM
for monitoring the detector performance, since it can help to identify
hardware problems in calorimeter, as it is explained below.

Fig.~\ref{fig:SumET_vs_run}-\ref{fig:MEy_vs_run} show distributions of
various calorimetric variables versus run number for the 2009 data-taking
period. This distribution clearly shows that in some of the runs there
were calorimeter problems that affected measured distributions. It was
confirmed by HCAL DQM that in runs 123970, 123976, 123977,
123978, 123985, 123987 the high voltages for HCAL HB and HE were off. As
a result, the total energy reconstructed in the event was lower than in
an event with fully operational HCAL, which explains the drop in
the mean of $\sum E_\text{T}$ and $\etmiss$ as shown on
Fig.\ref{fig:SumET_vs_run}, \ref{fig:MET_vs_run}. Runs 124006, 124008, 124009, which
also deviate from the trend, were identified by ECAL DQM as having a
noise in ECAL EE detector. As can be seen from
Fig.\ref{fig:SumET_vs_run}, \ref{fig:MET_vs_run}, the mean of $\sum E_\text{T}$
distributions in these runs is higher than the average, since the noise
in EE made the apparent energy reconstructed in the event to appear
large. During the run 123985 HCAL HB and HE, and ECAL EB and EE
detectors were off, which can be
seen in these plots as the entry with the smallest mean transverse
energy.

Monitoring the $x$ and $y$ components of $\etmiss$ can be helpful in
identifying any asymmetric behaviour in the
calorimeters. In Fig.\ref{fig:MEx_vs_run} one can see a flat
distribution in $\exmiss$ indicating an expected behaviour. The
distribution of $\sigma$ of $\exmiss$ drops during the runs with parts of
detector off, which is expected since the $\sigma_{\etmiss}$ is
proportional to $\sum E_\text{T}$. However, the distribution on
Fig.\ref{fig:MEy_vs_run} shows a drop during runs with HB and HE off,
which may indicate that there is some asymmetry in the response of the
ECAL calorimeter.
