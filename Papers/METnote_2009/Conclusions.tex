\section{Conclusions}
We presented a study of the performance of raw calorimetric $\etmiss$
reconstruction in proton-proton collision events collected by the CMS
experiment during the LHC commissioning phase in December 2009. Data
samples collected at $\sqrt{s}=900$ and $2360$~GeV are analyzed in this
note. Comparisons of $\etmiss$ and related quantities in collision data
with Monte Carlo simulation showed a good agreement. It was observed
that most of the collision energy in the forward region is modeled
reasonably well, and $\etmiss$ resolutions are in decent agreement with
simulation. A set of noise clean up algorithms was implemented, and
these algorithms perform quite well in the MinBias dataset. A few events that
remain in $\etmiss$ tails seem to originate from HCAL noise, and more
sophisticated algorithms for identifying these types of events will need
to be developed to reject them.
