%    There are three kind of CMS papers: ``CMS Note'', 
%    ``CMS Internal Note'' and ``CMS Conference Report''.
%    They differ only in the header of the first page,
%    which includes an eps figure different for each kind.
%    One of the following commands must be selected,
%    where \verb$yyyy$ is the current year
%    and \verb$xxx$ is the document number allocated by the CMS secretariat:
%{\small \begin{verbatim}
%  \cmsnote{yyyy-xxx}
%  \internalnote{yyyy-xxx}
%  \conferencereport{yyyy-xxx}
%\end{verbatim} }
    
%Apart from the title and authors some supplementary information can be given
%on the first page:
