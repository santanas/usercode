This document summarizes the searches for heavy resonances decaying to
massive bosons at the TeV mass scale. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity
up to about 20 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV with the ATLAS and CMS detector at the CERN LHC. 
The bosons coming from the resonance decay can be W, Z, 
or the standard model Higgs. Several final states are
considered: fully leptonic, leptons plus jets, 
and fully hadronic final sates. Techniques aiming at identifying jet
substructures are used to analyze signal events in which the
hadronization products from the decay of highly boosted W or Z 
bosons are contained within a single reconstructed jet. 
No significant excess above the standard model prediction is observed
in data. Upper limits on the production of diboson resonances are 
set as a function of the resonance mass and width. 
These searches provide the most stringent direct limits to date on the production of these
hypothesized TeV-scale resonances.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
One century of experimental measurements and progress in theoretical
physics led to an extremely compact and elegant theory of fundamental
interactions between elementary particles, the standard model (SM). 
Its success in reproducing measurements from different experiments in
energy regimes spanning over several orders of magnitude is
astonishing. The relatively recent discovery of the Higgs boson (H)
at the CERN Large Hadronc Collider (LHC) is another confirmation of
the success of the SM. Still there are several open questions which
cannot be answered in the contest of the SM, of which some of the most
important ones are: {\it what is the dark matter?}, {\it what is the cause of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe?}, {\it what is the reason for
the large difference between the electroweak and the gravity scale?}

Looking for signs of new physics beyond the SM at the TeV scale might
help to answer some of these fundamental questions. One of the most
direct ways to find new physics at the TeV scale is to search for new resonances.
Colliding hadrons at the highest reachable energy to possibly create 
and study these new massive states has been a successful experimental
approach in particle physics during the last 50 years. 
%An historical, but relevant example: in early
%60s the collisions of hadrons reached
%a new energy frontier of $\sqrt{s}\sim$ GeV and new resonances were promptly discovered (see 
%as example the discoveries of $\rho(770)\rightarrow \pi\pi$~\cite{}, $K^{*}(892)\rightarrow
%$K$\pi$~\cite{}, $\phi(1020)\rightarrow KK$~\cite{}, and others in the few years
%after 1960). The known properties of pions and kaons (mass, decays,
%quantum numbers) were exploited to study these new particles.
%The same general experimental strategy can be
%applied at the LHC with the difference that the collider energy is
%much larger, thus allowing to study the production of heavy resonances
%in the TeV mass range. 
%These heavy resonances are typically
%unstable and we can detect them by looking at their decay products.
This document presents searches for heavy resonances decaying to SM
bosons. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity
up to about 20 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV with the ATLAS~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003} 
and CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa} detectors at the CERN LHC. 
The bosons coming from the resonance decay can be photon, W, Z, or H. 
One of the main advantages of these searches is the clean 
experimental signature, thanks to the known properties
and decay kinematics of the SM bosons. Diboson resonances
are also predicted in many model of new physics beyond the SM, such as
the sequential standard model extension~\cite{Altarelli:1989ff},
composite Higgs
models~\cite{Kaplan:1983fs,Contino:2006nn,Giudice:2007fh}, 
scenarios with extra 
dimensions~\cite{Randall:1999ee,Agashe:2007zd,Fitzpatrick:2007qr,Antipin:2007pi}, 
Technicolor~\cite{Susskind:1978ms,Lane:1999uh,Eichten:2007sx} and others.

In Section~\ref{sec:HH} we present searches for resonances that decay to
pairs of SM Higgs bosons. Section~\ref{sec:VV} summarises the results of
searches for resonances decaying to pairs of V bosons (where V
indicates either W or Z). 
Results of searches for heavy resonances decaying to 
$\gamma\gamma$~\cite{CMS:2014onr}, W$\gamma$/Z$\gamma$~\cite{Aad:2014fha}, and 
 HH/ZH in the multileptons and photons~\cite{Khachatryan:2014jya} final states 
are discussed in more details in other proceedings of this conference
(see M. Kenzie's, K. Terashi's, and O. Bondu’s proceedings).
%In Section~\ref{sec:Comparison} we compare the results of some of these
%searches using a benchmark theoretical model. 
In Section~\ref{sec:Conclusion} we conclude by summarizing the current status of the
diboson searches at LHC and we give some prospects for future studies
during the second run-phase of the LHC.

\section{HH Resonances}
\label{sec:HH}

Both ATLAS and CMS have searched for heavy resonances (X) decaying to
pairs of Higgs bosons in the $\rm{X}\rightarrow\rm{HH}\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ and $\rm{X}\rightarrow\rm{HH}\rightarrow 4\rm{b}$ final states. 
The $\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ channel is a powerful final state in which
to search for Higgs boson pair production, thanks to the large
$\rm{H}\rightarrow\rm{bb}$ branching ratio ($\sim$57\%), clean diphoton trigger,
excellent diphoton invariant mass resolution (about 1\% for the SM Higgs), and low
backgrounds. This channel is particularly important in search for
resonances with mass below 500 GeV. At higher resonance masses, the 4b channel
dominates the sensitivity to new physics thanks to the larger branching ratio.


\subsection{$\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ Channel}

The ATLAS $\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ analysis~\cite{Aad:2014yja} starts by requiring an
$\rm{H}\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ candidate in the event, accordingly
with the standard model analysis. In addition two jets, identified as
coming from hadronization of b quarks (b-jets), are required with dijet
mass $95<m_{jj}<135$~GeV compatible with the Higgs boson
signature. Finally the mass of the $\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ system
($m_{\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}}$) is required to be consistent with the
hypothesised resonance mass ($m_X$). The search is performed as a counting 
experiment where the  $\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ requirement varies as a
function of $m_X$. The SM backgrounds are estimated from
$m_{\gamma\gamma}$ sidebands and events with less than 2 b-jets. 

The CMS $\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}$ selection~\cite{CMS:2014ipa} is conceptually similar to the
ATLAS one. A few differences in the analysis strategy are represented by the presence of
two separate event categories (1 or 2 b-jets), lower requirement on jet $p_{\rm{T}}$
(25 GeV instead of 35-55 GeV of the ATLAS search), and the use of a shape analysis (instead of a
counting experiment) in either the $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ or the
$m_{\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}}$ distribution, depending on the resonance
mass tested.

The ATLAS search observes a broad excess of events compared to SM
predictions at a resonance mass around 300 GeV. The event distribution
does not seem consistent with the $m_{\gamma\gamma\rm{bb}}$ resolution
of a narrow resonance. Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_HH_ggbb} shows the upper limits on
production cross section times branching ratio as a function of the
resonance mass. The broad excess is visible within the 2$\sigma$ bands
of the expected limit. By visual comparison with the CMS results in
Figure~\ref{fig:CMS_HH_summary} (see the dark blue lines), after dividing the CMS limit by the factor
$\rm{BR(}\rm{HH}\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\rm{bb}\rm{)}\sim0.2\%$ to
match the y-axis scale in the two plots, we notice that the ATLAS excess seems to be excluded by
the CMS constraints on the same production cross section. The CMS
analysis also appear more sensitive than the ATLAS one, providing
expected upper limits about 50\% smaller.

  (HIG-13-032~\cite{CMS:2014ipa}), and multileptons and photons
  (HIG-13-025~\cite{Khachatryan:2014jya}) final
  states. Theoretical cross sections for the RS1-radion, with
  $\Lambda_R = 1$ and 3 TeV, kL = 35, and no radion-Higgs mixing are overlaid.}\label{fig:CMS_HH_summary}
\end{figure}

\subsection{4b Channel}
The ATLAS HH$\rightarrow$4b selection~\cite{Aad:2014yja} requires at least 4 b-jets with
$p_{\rm{T}}>40$~GeV. Two unique dijets (system of two jets) are formed
from the four highest-$p_{\rm{T}}$ b-tagged jets requiring for each
dijet system a maximum angular separation between the jets
($\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^2+\Delta\eta^2}<1.5$)
and the $p_{\rm{T}}^{\rm{dijet}}>200$~GeV. A set of kinematic
requirements are applied in order to reduce the $\rm{t}\bar{\rm{t}}$
background, including a veto on extra jets in the event, as well as 
selections to isolate the $\rm{t}\bar{\rm{t}}$ decay kinematics.
After this selection, the dominant background is coming from QCD
multijet events. The QCD background is estimated from data using an
extrapolation from events with 2-bjets in the 4 b-jet signal
region. The 4b invariant mass resolution is of the order of 15\% for a
resonance mass of 1 TeV. No excess in data above the SM background
expectation is observed. Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_HH_4b_limit} shows the upper limits 
on production cross section for a bulk graviton~\cite{Agashe:2007zd} that decays to
HH in the 4b channel. The upper limits increase for resonance masses
above 1 TeV; in this mass range, the Higgs bosons from resonance decay
are highly boosted and their decay products are contained within a
single reconstructed jet. This causes an inefficiency in the 4b
selection, because it's not possible to reconstruct 4 resolved jets. 
Techniques aiming to solve this experimental issue will be discussed
later in Section~\ref{sec:JetSubstructure} in the contest of the VV searches. 

After the ICHEP2014 conference, the CMS collaboration released the
results of a similar HH search in 4b final state~\cite{CMS:2014eda}. The CMS
limit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_HH_summary} (red line). 
The sensitivities of the ATLAS and CMS analysis are comparable in the 
overlapping mass range between 0.5 and 1.1 TeV.

  leading-order prediction for $\sigma(\rm{pp}\rightarrow \rm{G}_{\{bulk} \rightarrow \rm{HH} \rightarrow 4b)$ 
as a function of the resonance mass in the bulk RS model with
$k/M_{\rm{Planck}} = 1.0$~\cite{Aad:2014yja}.}\label{fig:ATLAS_HH_4b_limit}
\end{figure}

%We point out that the limits shown in Figure~\ref{} refer to a spin-2 resonance 
%while the limits from in Figure~\ref{} refer to a spin-0
%resonance. Only small differences, of the order of 10-15\% are observed in
%the upper limits between spin-0 and spin-2 hypotheses for the same
%analysis, thus an approximate comparison is still possible.

\section{VV Resonances}
\label{sec:VV}

There ia a rich physics program on searches for VV resonances at LHC.
Fully-leptonic, semi-leptonic, and fully-hadronic final states have 
been considered. 
The Higgs boson itself is a VV resonance, and the study of these final
states has covered a crucial role in its discovery. Searches for
heavier partners of the Higgs are carried out in the contest 
of the two-Higgs-doublet models~\cite{Branco:2011iw} up to resonance
masses of about 1 TeV. We'll not cover these studies in this
document. We focus instead on searches for exotic neutral (WW, ZZ) and
charged (WZ) resonances with masses typically beyond the TeV scale. 

\subsection{Jet Substructure}
\label{sec:JetSubstructure}
VV final states with jets are important because of the large
branching ratio of Z and W to hadrons and good jet energy resolution 
at high jet transverse momenta. At high mass, where the SM
background is small, they exceed the sensitivity of the fully-leptonic
channels. For large values of the resonance mass, the two quarks originating
from the hadronically decaying W or Z bosons are highly collimated and
are typically reconstructed as a single massive jet (``V jet'').
The analyses presented here use the additional information 
from jet substructure to perform jet ``V tagging'' and to further 
suppress the SM background.
%, which mainly originates 
%from the SM production of V + jets and non-resonant VV events. 

The identification of a V jet
with respect to a background jet initiated from the hadronization 
of a quark or gluon, typically happens in two
steps. In the first step, grooming algorithms (such as trimming~\cite{Krohn:2009th},
pruning~\cite{Ellis:2009su,Ellis:2009me},
filtering~\cite{Butterworth:2008iy}) are applied to the candidate jet to remove
the soft components, reducing effects of pileup (multiple pp interactions
in the same bunch-crossing) and underlying event of the hard
interaction. This allows to better identify the presence of
substructure inside the jet. In the second step, jet declustering
algorithms are applied to form subjets within the original jet, and
substructure variables are built to discriminate signal from
background. The most powerful variable is the jet mass: Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_JetMass}
shows the good separation between V$\rightarrow$qq jets and regular
QCD background jets. The V$\rightarrow$qq distributions 
peak around the V mass (80-90 GeV) while the distributions from 
quark/gluon-initiated jets peak at much lower mass values. 
Additional variables, such as N-subjettiness~\cite{Thaler:2010tr}, 
momentum balance~\cite{Butterworth:2008iy} and others, are used
in conjunction with the jet mass to improve the signal to background ratio.
These methods has been validated in data using a pure sample of high
$p_{\rm{T}}$ W bosons from $\rm{t}\bar{\rm{t}}$ events. 
More details on the application of these techniques with the CMS and
ATLAS detectors can be found at~\cite{CMS:2013uea} and~\cite{ATLAS:ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-004}
respectively.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=8cm]{CMS_JetMass.pdf}
\caption{Distribution for pruned-jet mass in CMS data, and in simulations of signal and background events. All simulated distributions are scaled to match the number of events in data.

\end{figure}

%The VV final state has covered a crucial role in Higgs boson discovery at 
%LHC. Being the Higgs relatively light, the fully-leptonic channels
%(H$\rightarrow$ZZ$\rightarrow$4$\ell$ and
%H$\rightarrow$WW$\rightarrow$$\ell\nu\ell'\nu'$) are the most
%sensitive ones thanks to the clean signature, large background reduction,
%and excellent mass resolution in the 4$\ell$ final state; this is true 
%despite of the relatively small branching ratios compared to
%semi-leptonic and fully-hadronic final states. 
%New resonances decaying to a pair of vector bosons are also foreseen
%by many models of physics beyond the SM. 

\subsection{Fully-Leptonic Final States}
\label{sec:VVFullyLeptonic}

Searches for exotic charged particles decaying to WZ$\rightarrow
\ell\nu\ell\ell$, where $\ell$ is either an electron or a muon, 
have been performed in both ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2014pha} and CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014xja}. 
This fully-leptonic channel is characterized by a pair of
same-flavour, opposite charge, isolated leptons with high $p_{{T}}$
and an invariant mass consistent with that of the Z boson. A third, 
high $p_{{T}}$, isolated charge leptons is also present, along with
missing transverse momentum associated with the neutrino. 
Four channels are therefore considered: 
ee$\nu$e, ee$\nu\mu$, $\mu\mu\nu$e, and $\mu\mu\nu\mu$.
The branching ratio in these final states is small (about 1.5\%), but
the signature is very clean. The primary background is infact the 
irreducible SM WZ production.
An increase in sensitivity compared to the previous results 
is achieved at high resonance masses by using optimised isolation 
criteria that successfully take into account collimated leptons 
from highly boosted Z bosons. The signal would appear as a bump in the
$m_{WZ}$. In order to compute the mass, the undetectable longitudinal 
component of the neutrino momentum is extracted from the visible 
energy by using the constraint on the known W mass. 
With this method, the $m_{WZ}$ resolution reaches about ~10\%. 
The CMS analysis is performed as a counting
experiment after requiring that the reconstructed $m_{WZ}$ is within
an optimised range around the hypothesised resonance mass. The ATLAS
analysis employes a shape analysis on the $m_{WZ}$ spectrum. No sign
of new resonances is observed in the data. 
The CMS and ATLAS limits on the resonance production cross section 
are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:CMS_WZ_FullyLept_limit} 
and ~\ref{fig:ATLAS_WZ_FullyLept_limit},
respectively. Different model are tested: Sequential SM~\cite{Altarelli:1989ff}, 
Technicolor~\cite{Susskind:1978ms,Lane:1999uh,Eichten:2007sx}, Heavy Vector Triplet~\cite{Pappadopulo:2014qza}. 
The sensitivity of the two analysis is very similar: as an example, 
the expected (observed) mass limit on a Sequential SM W' is 
1.55 (1.47) TeV for the CMS analysis, and 1.52 (1.49) TeV for 
the ATLAS analysis.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Semi-Leptonic and Fully-Hadronic Final States}
\label{sec:VVWithJets}

Final states with jets are important at high resonance mass thanks to
the larger branching ratio compared to the fully-leptonic channels.
The final states investigated so far are: ZV$\rightarrow
\ell\ell +$V-jet (ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2014xka} and CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha}), 
WV$\rightarrow \ell\nu +$V-jet (CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha}), and
WV/ZV$\rightarrow$2 V-jets (CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014hpa}), where V can be either a W or
a Z. The back-to-back topology of the two bosons from resonance decay is required in
the event selection. Selection criteria are kept relatively loose in order
to allow a model-independent search. Jet substructure techniques described in
Section~\ref{sec:JetSubstructure} are used to identify the hadronic decays of 
boosted vector bosons. In order to discriminate against multijet
backgrounds, both the reconstructed jet mass, which is required to be
close to the W- or Z-boson mass, and the two-prong jet substructure
produced by the particle cascades of two high-pT quarks merging into
one jet, are exploited. The analysis strategy is a bump search in the reconstructed VV 
mass spectrum ($m_{VV}$). Depending of the final state, the $m_{VV}$ resolution ranges
from 3\% to 6\% for resonance masses above $\sim$1~TeV. 

In the semi-leptonic channels, 
the dominant SM background comes from V+jets processes.
The V+jets background is estimated from
data using events with jet mass not compatible with the V boson mass. 
The SM non-resonant VV production is an irreducible background, but it
contributes significantly only in the tails of the $m_{VV}$
distributions. In the $\ell\nu +$V-jet channel, a veto to suppress
$\rm{t}\bar{\rm{t}}$ is also applied. The $\rm{t}\bar{\rm{t}}$ and VV 
backgrounds are taken from simulation after correcting for 
differences between data and simulation in the V tagging derived 
from control regions in data. 

In the fully-hadronic channel, the dominant background 
is represented by QCD multijet events. The background is estimated
from data by fitting the $m_{VV}$ distribution in the signal region 
with a smoothly falling function. This channel is sensitive to
ZZ, WW, and WZ resonances. Also qW and qZ resonances can be 
searched for using this analysis, by applying the V tagging
on only one of the two leading jets.

No significant evidence of new physics beyond the 
standard model is observed in these searches.
Figure~\ref{fig:CMS_VV_limits} shows the limits on production cross section for the
three CMS analyses in the semi-leptonic~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha} and
fully-hadronic~\cite{Khachatryan:2014hpa} final states. 
The combination of the results is also shown under the
hypothesis of a narrow bulk graviton model. In this scenario, $\ell\nu
+$V-jet is the most sensitive channel for resonance masses greater
than 800 GeV. By comparing the expected limits with the observed ones,
we notice a small excess in data compared to background
prediction in all 3 channels for a resonance mass around 1.8~TeV. 
The smallest discrepancy is present in the most sensitive channel, 
and thus dominates the overall significance of the excess 
(p-value around 0.1, about only 1$\sigma$).
Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_llVjet_limits} shows the limits on production cross section for the 
ATLAS $\ell\ell+$V-jet analysis~\cite{Aad:2014xka}. The sensitivity is comparable with
the corresponding CMS analysis.

The combination is shown only in the mass range where at least two analyses contribute.}

Some of the analyses presented above are specific to the case of a 
narrow bulk graviton model, but this is not the only extension 
of the SM predicting resonances decaying to vector bosons. 
We can consider narrow/wide resonances, different charge/spin
hypothesis, as well as different V polarisation.
The CMS semi-leptonic searches allow the reinterpretation of the results
in a generic model greatly extending the versatility of the analysis.
Efficiencies to reconstruct and identify a vector boson decay are provided as 
a function of the boson kinematics ($\eta$ and
$p_{\rm{T}}$). Upper limits on the number of signal events are also
provided using a simplified event selection as a function of the
resonance mass (from 600-800 GeV to 2500 GeV) and width (up to
$\Gamma/\rm{M}=40\%$). 
This allows to test a generic resonance model by comparing the 
expected signal yield, obtained by reweighting the generated events with
the reconstruction efficiencies, with the experimental upper limits on
number of signal events. More details on the use of these model-independent limits 
can be found in the Appendix of Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2014gha}.

\section{Conclusions and Future Prospects}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

We have presented the status of searches for heavy resonances
at the TeV scale that decay to a pair of SM bosons, focusing 
on the HH and VV final states. Various theory models have
been tested. Bulk gravitons with $k/M_{\rm{Planck}} = 1.0$ 
can be excluded at 95\% confidence level (CL) up to masses of about
800 GeV. Sequential SM W' can be excluded up to about 1.8 TeV.
The HVT model~\cite{Pappadopulo:2014qza} represents a interesting benchmark 
for diboson searches. The method described in the paper is based on a
simplified Lagrangian which reproduces a large class of explicit
theory models of physics beyond the SM. The so-called ``model B'',
which reproduces Composite Higgs models, is particularly interesting in
this contest because it predicts the existence of two spin-1
resonances, one neutral (Z') and one charged (W'), with approximately the same
mass (within few GeV), and with primary decays in WW/ZH and WZ/WH
final states, respectively. So far only the ATLAS experiment has considered this
model in the contest of the fully-leptonic WZ
search~\cite{Aad:2014pha}. We propose that more effort is made in
future to quote limits on resonance masses and coupling parameters within
this particular model; this will allow a useful comparison among the different
diboson analyses as well as a direct comparison of the sensitivity between the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.

Table~\ref{tab:summary} summarises the final states from
the main decays of a TeV-scale resonance to a pair of SM bosons (excluding 
final states with photons which are not described in this document). 
The table also indicates which searches has been already performed at
$\sqrt{s}=7\mbox{ and } 8$~TeV at the LHC in the contest of the ``exotic
physics'' groups of ATLAS and CMS (excluding the Higgs 
searches to diboson final states for resonance masses below 1 TeV). 
Although many searches has been already performed, 
several final states still need to be studied. In particular ZH and WH
searches for TeV scale resonances are currently missing. We expect new
results on 8 TeV data analysis in the next months.

After the first run at $\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV, the physics program of
the LHC will continue starting in Summer 2015 at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. 
One of the primary physics goal will be the search for new physics
in a new, unexplored energy range. There will be a large 
increase in sensitivity to TeV-scale resonance thanks to the larger 
center-of-mass-energy. We expect to exceed the current limits 
on production of resonances with mass greater than 2 TeV
already after the first 3 weeks of data taking at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV
(corresponding to about one inverse femtobarn of pp collision data). The highest priority 
among the diboson searches should probably be given to the
semi-leptonic and fully-hadronic final
states, being the most sensitive channels at high mass in the 8 TeV analyses.
