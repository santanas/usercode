\section{Introduction}

The large cross section of processes decaying in quarks and gluons 
at the Large Hadron Collider makes searches for resonances decaying 
into hadronic jets an attractive ground to test the validity of the Standard Model 
to the highest energy scales. This review outlines a selection of searches
for hadronic resonances performed at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, and discusses
a series of points that are deemed important for current and future searches.

\section{Jet reconstruction and calibration: da tagliare?}

Both ATLAS and CMS employ similar algorithms and techniques for jet reconstruction, 
as most searches employ the \antikt{} jet finding algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp},
although the inputs for jet finding are different. ATLAS uses energy deposits from the calorimeters,
while CMS complements the calorimeter information with measurements of particle momenta
from the inner detector. The hadronic energy scale is calibrated using a series of corrections 
derived both from Monte-Carlo simulation and from 
data~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-004, 1748-0221-6-11-P11002, Aad:2011he}. 
The jet energy scale uncertainty, which dominates among the sources of systematic 
uncertainty for most of the searches described in this review, is derived using data-driven 
techniques and has a similar magnitude across
jet transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$ and pseudorapidities $\eta$ for the two experiments. 
However, as it can be noted in Figure~\ref{Fig:JESUnc}, 
the estimate of the uncertainty for jets above 2~TeV differs between ATLAS and CMS.

\section{Review of selected searches in the ATLAS and CMS experiments}

The searches for hadronic resonances can be categorized into the following two categories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Searches where the quarks and gluons produced
by the resonance decay are each reconstructed into single \textit{resolved} hadronic jets;
 \item Searches where the decay products are \textit{boosted} 
(the resonance has a large transverse momentum compared to its mass) so that a single 
hadronic jet with a large distance parameter (\textit{fat jet}) encompasses them all. 
Techniques that exploit the presence of substructure within the \textit{fat jet}
are employed to reject background from standard QCD jets and multiple interactions within 
the same bunch crossing (pile-up). 
\end{itemize}

The quintessential example of hadronic search with resolved jets is the 
search for resonances in the dijet mass distribution. New particles, 
or excitations of quarks indicating further substructure, could manifest 
themselves as narrow 'bumps' in the dijet mass distribution of central leading
and subleading jets above the continuum QCD background~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-059, ATLAS-CONF-2012-148}. 
The search can be tailored to specific resonances
decaying to heavy quark flavors using $b-$tagging for one or both jets~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-023}. 
No excess over the background has been found for the current ATLAS and CMS analyses,
and lower limits are set on the masses of new particles (Fig.~\ref{Fig:DijetRes}~(a)), 
including model-independent Gaussian resonances of varying width (Fig.~\ref{Fig:DijetRes}~(b)).

\caption{95\% CL limits from dijet mass resonance searches.}
\label{Fig:DijetRes}
\end{figure}

Searches for resonances in high jet multiplicity signatures tailored towards R-Parity Violating supersymmetric 
signatures (gluino cascade decays) can be performed in both the resolved and the boosted regimes~\cite{Chatrchyan2012329,SUSYRPVATLAS}.
Both experiments select events with six or more jets, but the background estimation techniques 
for ATLAS and CMS differ. In the resolved channel, ATLAS employs the $p_\mathrm{T}$
of the sixth jet as a discriminant variable, while CMS performs a 'bump-search' in the 
three-jet invariant mass. The combinatorial background (from both the QCD background and the signal)
penalizes the CMS search and allows the ATLAS search to set more stringent limits. A proof-of-principle
boosted jet analysis, although not as sensitive as the resolved one, is also carried on by the ATLAS experiment. 
 
In the case of resonances decaying into top quark or heavy boson pairs, the use of jet substructure 
techniques is crucial to achieve a good background rejection. In those cases the decay products 
from TeV-scale resonances are boosted, and therefore spatially collimated when reconstructed in áº—he detector.  
Specific techniques for top-tagging, based on the presence of three hard energy deposit corresponding
to the top decay products, have been employed to distinguish top-jets from jets originated from quarks and gluons
that constitute the majority of the QCD background~\cite{Kaplan:2008ie, Plehn:2010st, ATLAS-CONF-2012-065, Almeida:2010pa}. 
Both ATLAS and CMS look for heavy resonances decaying in $t\bar{t}$ at 7 and 8 TeV, 
in semileptonic and all-hadronic top decays~\cite{TtbarResCMS, TtbarResATLAS, CMS-PAS-B2G-12-005, ATLAS-CONF-2013-052}
\textbf{[Devo aggiungere i semileptonici per completezza credo]}. Given no excesses above background, limits are
set on benchmark models. The CMS experiment employs boson-tagging techniques based on the
