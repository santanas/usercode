\section{Introduction}
New resonances, that couples to quarks and gluons and decay to final states with hadronic jets, 
can be produced copiously at the Large Hadron Collider (CERN). 
%The large cross section of processes decaying in quarks and gluons 
%at the Large Hadron Collider makes searches for new, heavy resonances decaying 
%into hadronic jets an attractive ground to test the validity of the Standard Model 
%to the highest energy scales. 
This review outlines a selection of searches for heavy resonances in hadronic final states 
performed at the ATLAS and CMS experiments using the proton-proton collision data collected 
at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV (2011) and 8 TeV (2012). A series of points that 
are deemed important for current and future searches are also discussed.

%\section{Jet reconstruction and calibration: da tagliare?}

%Both ATLAS and CMS employ similar algorithms and techniques for jet reconstruction, 
%as most searches employ the \antikt{} jet finding algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp},
%although the inputs for jet finding are different. ATLAS uses energy deposits from the calorimeters,
%while CMS complements the calorimeter information with measurements of particle momenta
%from the inner detector. The hadronic energy scale is calibrated using a series of corrections 
%derived both from Monte-Carlo simulation and from 
%data~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-004, 1748-0221-6-11-P11002, Aad:2011he}. 
%The jet energy scale uncertainty, which dominates among the sources of systematic 
%uncertainty for most of the searches described in this review, is derived using data-driven 
%techniques and has a similar magnitude across
%jet transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$ and pseudorapidities $\eta$ for the two experiments. 
%However, as it can be noted in Figure~\ref{Fig:JESUnc}, 
%the estimate of the uncertainty for jets above 2~TeV differs between ATLAS and CMS.

\section{Overview of selected searches in the ATLAS and CMS experiments}

The searches for hadronic resonances can be divided into two main categories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf Resolved topology} - Searches where the quarks and gluons produced in the final state are each reconstructed at detector level into single,  \textit{resolved} hadronic jets. Examples are the single production of a resonance X decaying to a pair of gluons, or the pair production of two resonances X at rest each decaying to a quark-antiquark pair;
 \item {\bf Boosted topology} - Searches where the quarks and gluons produced in the final state are merged into a single reconstructed jet.  A typical example is the decay of a resonance X into a pair of massive particles Y, with $\mbox{M}_{\mbox{X}} >>\mbox{M}_{\mbox{Y}} $, and Y decays to a pair of light quarks. In this case the resonance Y will be \textit{boosted} 
(the resonance has a large momentum compared to its mass) so that a single hadronic jet with a large distance 
parameter (\textit{fat jet}) encompasses all its decay products. Techniques that exploit the presence of substructure within the \textit{fat jet} are employed to reject background from standard QCD jets and multiple interactions within the same bunch crossing (pile-up). 
\end{itemize}

The quintessential example of hadronic search with resolved jets is the 
search for heavy resonances in the dijet mass distribution. New particles, 
or excitations of quarks indicating 
compositeness,
%further substructure
could manifest 
themselves as narrow 'bumps' in the dijet mass distribution of central leading
and subleading jets above the continuum QCD background~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-059, ATLAS-CONF-2012-148}. 
The search can be tailored to specific resonances
decaying to heavy quark flavors using $b-$tagging for one or both jets~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-023}. 
No significant excess over the background has been found for the current ATLAS and CMS analyses,
and lower limits are set on the masses of new particles 
%(Fig.~\ref{Fig:DijetRes}~(a)), 
including model-independent Gaussian resonances of varying width.
%(Fig.~\ref{Fig:DijetRes}~(b)). 
Upper limits on cross section times branching fraction to jets times acceptance of the order of $100$, $10$, and 
$1$~fb at resonance masses of 1.5, 3, and 4.5 TeV, respectively, are set by both experiments.

Searches for resonances in final states with high jet multiplicity, tailored towards R-Parity Violating supersymmetric 
signatures (such as 3-body decays into quarks of pair produced gluinos, giving a six jet final state), can be performed in both resolved and boosted regimes~\cite{Chatrchyan2012329,SUSYRPVATLAS}.
Both experiments select events with six or more jets, but the background estimation techniques 
for ATLAS and CMS differ. In the resolved channel, ATLAS employs the $p_\mathrm{T}$
of the sixth jet as a discriminant variable, while CMS performs a 'bump-search' in the 
three-jet invariant mass. The combinatorial background (from both the QCD background and the signal)
penalizes the CMS search and allows the ATLAS search to set more stringent limits. A proof-of-principle
boosted jet analysis, although not as sensitive as the resolved one, is also carried on by the ATLAS experiment. 
 
In the case of resonances decaying into pairs of top quarks ($\mbox{t}\bar{\mbox{t}}$) or heavy bosons (WW, ZZ, HH, HZ, ..), 
the use of jet substructure techniques is crucial to achieve a good background rejection. 
In these cases, the tops or heavy bosons coming from a TeV-scale resonance 
are boosted, and therefore their decay products are spatially collimated when reconstructed in the detector.  

Specific techniques for top-tagging, based on the presence of three hard energy deposit corresponding
to the top decay products, have been employed to distinguish top-jets from jets originated from quarks and gluons
that constitute the majority of the QCD background~\cite{Kaplan:2008ie, Plehn:2010st, ATLAS-CONF-2012-065, Almeida:2010pa}. 
Both ATLAS and CMS look for heavy resonances decaying in $t\bar{t}$ at 7 and 8 TeV, in semileptonic and all-hadronic top decays~\cite{TtbarResCMS, TtbarResATLAS, CMS-PAS-B2G-12-005, ATLAS-CONF-2013-052, CMS-PAS-B2G-12-006}.
The ATLAS analysis employes b-tagging to further suppress the QCD background and it sets limits starting from a resonance mass of 500 GeV. The CMS analysis, instead, does not use b-tagging and limits are set starting at a resonance mass of 1 TeV. 
The CMS expected upper limits on the resonance cross section are about a factor 3-4 lower than the ATLAS ones for resonance masses around 2 TeV.  A possible reason might be due to the use of b-tagging: on one side, the b-tag requirement allows the ATLAS analysis to start the search at lower resonance masses compared to CMS, by reducing significantly the QCD background; 
on the other hand, the low b-tag efficiency at high jet pT might penalize the ATLAS search at high resonance masses.

The CMS experiment has also performed a search for RS gravitons decaying to 
WW/ZZ and W'/Z' decaying to Wq/Zq~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ypy}. This analysis employs 
W/Z-tagging techniques based on the jet mass and the presence
of hard sub-jets to significantly reduce the background and keep a relatively high signal efficiency. 
Given no excesses above background, limits are set on a number benchmark models. 

\section{Discussion points}
