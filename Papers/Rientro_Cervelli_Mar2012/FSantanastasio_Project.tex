% EW SYMMETRY BREAKING IN SM (HIGGS)
One century of experimental measurements and progress in theoretical physics 
led to an extremely compact and elegant theory of fundamental interactions between 
elementary particles, the Standard Model (SM). Its success in reproducing 
measurements from different experiments in energy regimes spanning 
over several orders of magnitude is astonishing. 
Strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions are all described within the 
same mathematical framework of gauge theories. Although the electromagnetic and weak 
interactions are related to the same SU(2)$_L$ x U(1)$_Y$ invariance, only 
the electromagnetic symmetry is manifest in the mass spectrum. 
The rest of the electroweak symmetry is hidden, that is, it is spontaneously broken. 
The detailed mechanism through which the breaking happens is not clear, though. 
The simplest way this could be explained theoretically is through the 
so-called Higgs mechanism of the SM. This mechanism explain, for instance, why 
elementary particles have mass. The Higgs mechanism postulates the existence 
of a new scalar particle, the Higgs boson, whose mass is not theoretically predicted by 
the SM, but that should be experimentally observable at particle colliders. \\

% LHC 
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest proton-proton (pp) collider ever built. 
It is located at CERN, Geneva, and its main objective is to finally unravel the origin 
of the electroweak symmetry breaking. Using the pp collision data at the center-of-mass energy
of 7 TeV collected in 2011, ATLAS and CMS, the 
largest experiments at the LHC, excluded the SM Higgs in the mass range 
127-600 GeV, while masses below 114 GeV were already excluded by 
previous experiments at the electron-positron LEP collider. 
Thus, the mass range 114 GeV-127 GeV is currently the only one in which 
a Standard Model Higgs boson can hide, and it is in fact also the range 
preferred by the electroweak precision tests performed at LEP. 
In this mass range, the ATLAS and CMS experiments observe an excursion of 
the observed data from the expected background, that is compatible with the existence 
of a SM Higgs boson with mass around 125 GeV. However, no claim of 
discovery is possible at the moment given the small statistical significance of the excess. 

% THE 2012 RUN
In 2012, the LHC will collide protons at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, delivering 
a number of collisions three times higher than in 2011. The higher energy and larger 
amount of data will allow to either confirm the "125 GeV" signal or rule out the existence 
of a SM Higgs by the end of the year. The LHC is scheduled to enter a 
long technical stop at the end of 2012 to prepare for running at its full design 
center-of-mass energy of around 14 TeV in early 2015.

% EW SYMMETRY BREAKING IN SM (WW SCATTERING)
In this contest, the scattering of two longitudinally polarized 
W bosons (WW scattering) is a promising channel to 
investigate the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism.
In fact, in absence of the Higgs boson contribution, this SM process
would violate the unitarity of the diffusion amplitude
at a center-of-mass energy of around 1 TeV; thus we know that, in this scenario, 
interesting physics must emerge at that energy scale.
Anyway, the WW scattering carries a direct information about the EWSB 
mechanism, no matter whether a physical elementary Higgs particle 
exists or some kind of strongly interacting physics is responsible for this breaking. 
In fact, even if the "125 GeV" signal is confirmed with high statistical significance by the 
2012 data analysis, the energy dependence of the longitudinal WW scattering 
above the Higgs candidate mass scale will tell us if the SM Higgs boson 
unitarizes the WW scattering fully or only partially, as predicted in some 
theoretical models with composite Higgs. Therefore, the study of the WW scattering 
at high center-of-mass-energy is, in any case, a fundamental milestone 
in the physics program of the LHC experiments. \\

% PHYSICS BEYOND SM
Beyond this, it is important to mention that there are many unsatisfactory 
aspects in the picture depicted by the SM: the hierarchy problem, i.e. the big 
gap between the electroweak energy scale and the Planck scale at which 
quantum effects of gravity become strong, is seen as one of its major limitation 
and has been the driving force for many theoretical developments extending the 
SM. Although the panorama of alternative new physics models is wide, one the 
most appealing and popular alternative is represented by the existence of Extra Dimensions. 
In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, the hierarchy problem
of the SM is solved using a theoretical framework that includes a warped extra dimension
in which gravity can propagate. 
The most distinctive feature of this scenario is the existence of spin-2 gravitons
whose masses and couplings to the SM are set by the TeV scale. The gravitons 
appear in experiments as widely separated resonances. 
Decays of the graviton to pairs of electrons, muons, or photons are traditionally among 
the golden channels for searches of extra dimensions.
Well-motivated extensions of the original RS model address the flavor structure of the SM through 
localization of fermions in the warped bulk. This picture offers a unified geometric explanation 
of both the hierarchy and the flavor puzzles in the SM.
In this scenario, graviton production and decay with light fermion channels are 
highly suppressed and the decay into photons are negligible. 
However the production of KK gravitons from gluon fusion and 
their decay into a pair of longitudinal gauge bosons (W$_L$/Z$_L$) can be significant.
Therefore, also in the contest of physics beyond the SM, the study of final 
states with two vector bosons at high center-of-mass energy is particularly interesting.



%If the "125" GeV signal is confirmed in 2012 with large statistical significance, 
%it will be important to understand the real nature of this object 
%by measuring its couplings with the SM particles. 
%On the other hand, if nothing is found, it will become crucial 
%to measure the cross-section of rare SM processes that, in absence of the 
%Higgs boson contribution, would violate the unitarity of the diffusion amplitude, such 
%as the scattering of two longitudinally polarized W bosons (WW scattering).
%Those would be produced in association with two forward jets, that is a characteristic 
%experimental signature of the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production mechanism at hadron colliders.
