** Simple code to plot electron       **

##### using main_ele_isolation_ID.cc ####

TO BE IMPROVED

1) Edit Selection.h and Selection.cc (needed each time you use a new root tree)

take a template of rootfile (file.root) that you want to analyze
 (the Tree Name is "treename").
> root -l file.root
> treename.MakeClass("test") 

test.C and test.h will be created.

Edit Selection.cc and Selection.h accordingly to what present in test.h .
Remove then test.C and test.h
############

2) Compile the code  

> make main_ele_isolation_ID

3) Create the list with roofiles

chowder.txt, gumbo.txt and LQ1stgenM250_fast169_100pbScenario.txt
are 3 examples of list of rootfiles for different samples.
You must create your own list each time. 

(only gumbo and LQ really needed.)

4) Run the code

> ./launchAll_EleIsoID.csh

P.S. the correct usage of main_finalSelection.cc is
--- Correct Usage : exe eventProcess inputlist treename outputfilename
--- Correct Usage : eventProcess can be: all, ttbarjet, wjet, zjet, qcdjet, gammajet, leptoquark

The output files will be:

EleIsoID_fakeEle_QCD.root
EleIsoID_trueEle_LQ.root

which contain the output of the analysis

5) make final plots 

Edit PlotEleIsoID.C, for instance specifying which are the input root files 
for real and fake electron samples.

It plots all the electron isolation and ID variables for reco electrons matched with 
gen electrons from LQ decay, and for fake electrons from a sample of QCD jet events in the gumbo soup.

> root -l 
> .x PlotEleIsoID.C

Some (7) ".gif" plots are saved.
